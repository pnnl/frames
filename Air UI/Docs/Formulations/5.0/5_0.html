The air-as-source component is an input option that allows the investigator
to input a uniform regional air concentration of a contaminant. The exposure
pathways are computed based on having the same concentrations and deposition
rate everywhere over the region. That is,

<br>

<br>where C(x<font face="Symbol">,q</font>) is the air concentration at any arbitrary distance, x, and direction,<font face="Symbol">q</font>(degrees); and Ci is the input value
for ambient air concentrations (g/m<sup>3</sup>).

<br>&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Applications for the air-as-source component are mainly for evaluation
of background concentrations from sources of distant and/or poorly defined
origin. The air-as-source component may also be used to approximately evaluate
impacts from a disperse regional source term such as roadways.
