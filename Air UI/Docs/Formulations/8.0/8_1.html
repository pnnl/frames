<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The trajectory and diffusion of an atmospheric plume are known to be influ-enced
by complex terrain.&nbsp; A number of models have been developed to emulate
special processes in complex terrain (i.e., Burt 1977; Hovind et al. 1979;
Strimaitis et al. 1983; Allwine and Whiteman 1988; Bader and Whiteman 1989).&nbsp;
The effects of the underlying surfaces can modify the transport, dis-per-sion,
and deposition processes.&nbsp; Areas with high ground-level concen-tra-tions
can occur as the result of two different complex terrain effects.&nbsp;
First, under moderate or high wind conditions, an elevated plume may impinge
on local topographical features resulting in localized high-level concentra-tions.&nbsp;
Second, under low wind or stable atmospheric conditions, a channeling of
releases in a single direction can maximize ground-level concentrations.

<br>&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MEPAS accounts for the effects of underlying surfaces on the vertical wind
structure and the deposition rate of airborne pollutants onto these surfaces.&nbsp;
These formulations are designed to improve the computations of climatological
transport, dispersion, and deposition for a given site by using site-specific
input data.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A straight-line Gaussian atmospheric
model, which assumes the plume tra-jec-tories are in straight lines from
a central release point, cannot account for the processes in complex terrain
where the winds tend to follow local topo-graphical features (valleys,
gorges, slopes, etc.).&nbsp; A modified model has been developed that incorporates
the major influences of local channeling for wind channeling in the immediate
vicinity of the release.

<br>&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
An elevated release which is lower than surrounding terrain may inter-sect
local topographical features.&nbsp; Studies have shown that the tendency
for the plume to intersect a hill is a function of the ambient meteorological
condi-tions.&nbsp; The techniques described by Hanna et al. (1982) for
accounting for topographical interactions in complex terrain have been
adapted for appli-ca-tion in the MEPAS climatological dispersion component.&nbsp;
The formula-tions given below account for the tendency for winds to intersect
or flow over terrain features depending on ambient atmospheric conditions.
