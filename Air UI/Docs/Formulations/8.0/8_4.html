<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
complex terrain components use approximations based on average conditions
to improve the accuracy of simulation of environmental conditions. Although
the components described above will provide a reasonable estimate of the
average exposures, these components involve gross simplifications of the
atmospheric processes. Case studies of air movements in complex terrain
demonstrate the need for much more sophisticated models to predict detailed
exposure patterns. The MEPAS atmospheric component is only designed to
provide order-of-magnitude estimates of exposures in complex terrain.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The computation of the maximum individual exposure generally will be more
sensitive to the effects of complex terrain than the population exposure.
However, in situations where the tendency for air to flow (or not to flow)
from the release to surrounding population centers is controlled by terrain
effects, the complex terrain features can significantly affect population
exposures.
