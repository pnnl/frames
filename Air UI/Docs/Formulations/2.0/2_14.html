The volatilization formulations given are simplified estimation procedures
that yield approximate release rates based on site and contaminant properties.
Although these methods do not account for all the factors that can control
these volatile release rates, the estimated release-rates should provide
the order-of-magnitude estimates of potential rates required for the MEPAS
ranking applications. For site-specific applications a more exact release-rate
verification of computed release rates by monitoring data is recommended
by the EPA (1988).

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The accuracy of the MEPAS volatilization estimate depends directly on how
well the problem is characterized. The types, forms, and quantities of
chemicals involved need to be defined, along with the physical and chemical
properties of the various media.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Because the MEPAS methodology accounts for contaminant loss at the source
if the inventory is known, the potential exposures are limited to the amount
of material available. However, in cases where the inventory is unknown,
the model can release more material than is really associated with the
environmental problem. The total releases for cases with undefined inventories problem.
