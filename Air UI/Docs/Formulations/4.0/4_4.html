<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
MEPAS atmospheric component uses six classes of atmospheric stability to
characterize the dispersion rates. The atmospheric stability classes are
designated by the letters A to F (Slade 1968) and are commonly referred
to as the Pasquill Stability Categories (Pasquill and Smith 1983).

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the characterization of frequency of winds in each of these stability
classes, often some fraction of the reported cases are for calm or zero
wind speed conditions. Since the formulations for the climatological atmospheric
component require a non-zero wind speed, a method was adopted for handling
the reported calm conditions based on assigning these conditions a low,
non-zero wind speed in a manner that reflects the occurrences of winds
with low wind speeds. This procedure is appropriate because calm conditions
are more correctly defined as conditions when the winds are less than the
starting speed of the anemometer--the atmosphere is very seldom really
calm with no air movements.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The occurrences of calm conditions in each stability class are distributed
in a special wind speed class. The relative frequencies of occurrence of
winds in the lowest wind speed class are used to distribute calms as a
function of direction. If the lowest wind speed class has no entries, then
the calms are distributed equally over the 16 direction sectors. Calm conditions
are modeled with a wind speed of 0.5 m/s.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The input table of dispersion conditions is normalized to represent all
conditions. That is, missing conditions are distributed according to the
input frequencies of occurrence.
