<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once a contaminant material is airborne, it is transported and dispersed
by air movement. The contaminant will be carried by the winds, and the
atmospheric contaminant concentration will be reduced by dispersion and
deposition processes. The near-surface atmospheric concentrations computed
in the transport, dispersion, and deposition module of MEPAS provide the
basis for evaluating inhalation exposures.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The relative importance of the atmospheric pathway at various sites is
controlled by a combination of topographic and climatological influences.
Controlling parameters include the distance and direction from the inactive
waste site and the local wind conditions and stability. Because dispersion
is a strong function of the downwind distance a contaminant travels, the
physical distances between the contaminant site and population centers
are of prime importance. The local frequencies of wind occurrence by direction,
particularly in areas with topographic channeling of winds, are important
in calculating exposure and risk associated with contaminants in the atmospheric
pathway. The relative rates of atmospheric dilution between the sites are
mainly a function of local wind speeds and dilution (stability) parameters.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As a result of surface-induced mechanical mixing, the local surface roughness
influences local dispersion rates. The MEPAS formulation for local dispersion
rates accounts for the effect of local surface roughness. All other factors
being equal, a site with a smoother surface will have slower dilution rates
than a site with a rougher surface.
