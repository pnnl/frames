<B>1.0 Introduction</B>
<P>This document describes the requirements for the Multimedia Environmental
Pollutant Assessment System (MEPAS) Atmospheric Transport Module. This
module is specifically designed as an object for inclusion in the Framework
for Risk Analysis in Multimedia Environmental Systems (FRAMES), which is
a software platform that allows for the linking of various environmental
modules into complete emission, transport, and exposure assessment systems
(Whelan et al. 1997). These requirements can be used by software engineers
and testers to ensure that this module functions properly.  Test cases will be developed from the test plan to ensure that the product meets the needs of the clients and to establish a baseline version of the module.

<P><B>2.0 Purpose of the MEPAS Atmospheric Transport Module</B>
<P>The purpose of the MEPAS Atmospheric Transport Module is to simulate
the transport, dispersion, and deposition of chemical and radionuclide
constituents that become airborne. Input to the module consists of 1) time-varying,
contaminant mass fluxes to the atmosphere, 2) physical characteristics
of the source area, 3) average annual site/regional climatological dispersion
data, 4) site/regional topographical data, and 5) constituent properties.
The emission information originates from a source term module and constituent
properties originate from the Global Input Data (GID) file. All other inputs
are entered through a Module User Interface (MUI). Output consists of regional
patterns of time-varying, contaminant air concentrations (on an annual
basis) near the earth's surface, and time-varying, deposition rates (on
an annual basis) to earth's surface. The outputs may be endpoints for an
analysis or be used as input to other modules.

<P><B>3.0 Summary of Requirements for the MEPAS Atmospheric Transport Module</B>
<P>This section provides an overall summary of the requirements for the
MEPAS Atmospheric Transport Module and associated pre and post processors,
along with the specific requirements for the MUI. Detailed input, output,
and scientific requirements are described in the sections that follow.

<P>The MEPAS Atmospheric Transport Module will

<OL>
<LI>input data contained in the FRAMES Atmospheric Flux File (AFF) and Global
Input Data (GID) File as specified by the FRAMES data specifications (Whelan
et al. 1997)</LI>

and has the look and feel of Windows.</LI>

<LI>output ground level, annual average, time-varying, air concentrations and deposition rates
(wet and dry) by distance and direction into an Atmospheric Transport Output

</OL>

<B>4.0 Input Requirements for the MEPAS Atmospheric Transport Module</B>

<P>The MEPAS Atmospheric Transport Module has three sources of input to
conduct calculations:

<UL>
<LI>the AFF, which provides source characteristics and time-varying contaminant
emission rates</LI>

<LI>the GID file, which provides contaminant properties</LI>

<LI>the MUI, which provides climatology, joint frequency distribution, and
topographical data.</LI>
</UL>

The specifications for the GID and AFF files are described in Whelan et
al. (1997).<I></I>

<P><I>AFF Inputs. </I>The AFF is a FRAMES data specification file that
is defined as output from source modules and input to air modules. The
AFF provides the MEPAS Atmospheric Transport Module with

<LI>area of source or point exit</LI>

<LI>height of point source</LI>

<LI>building height for point source</LI>

<LI>exit velocity of point source</LI>

<LI>exit plume temperature for point source</LI>

<LI>number of flux types (particle size types)</LI>

<LI>time-varying, contaminant emission rates by particle size type.</LI>
</OL>

<I>GID File Inputs. </I>The GID file is a FRAMES data specification file
that contains all to contaminant property data for the entire set of modules
linked under FRAMES. The GID file provides the MEPAS Atmospheric Transport
Module with

<OL>

<LI>contaminant first order decay/degradation half-life.</LI>
</OL>

<I>MUI Inputs. </I>The MEPAS Atmospheric Transport Module MUI is divided
into three main data groups: 1) climatology, 2) joint frequency distribution,
and 3) topographical data. The MUI has the following general requirements:

<OL>
<LI>The MUI will operate in Windows 95 and will have a standard Windows look
and feel.</LI>

<LI>The MUI will have on-line electronic help in HTML format and provide users
with easy-to-understand description of all input parameters required by
the MUI, as well as an About tab that provides the user with title, version
number, and brief description of the model.</LI>

<LI>The MUI will provide users with different units for the appropriate input
parameters.</LI>

<LI>The MUI will provide a reference field for each input parameter in the
MUI.</LI>
</OL>

The user needs to input the following data into the MUI (some are option
depending on user selections):

<P><B>Climatology Data</B>

<OL>

<B>5.0 Output Requirements for the MEPAS Atmospheric Transport Module</B>

<P>The MEPAS Atmospheric Transport Module is required to output its results
to an Atmospheric Transport Output (ATO) file. The ATO is a FRAMES Air
Transport Module output file that is specified by the FRAMES data specifications
(Whelan et al. 1997) and may be used as input to other modules. This module
is also required to produce a listing file (*.ALS file) that documents
the data actually read in by the model and provides a summary of intermediate
calculation and simulation results.

<P>The MEPAS Atmospheric Transport Module outputs the following data to
the ATO file:

<OL>
<LI>output type (acute or chronic)</LI>

<LI>coordinate system type (polar or Cartesian)</LI>

<LI>spatial and temporal matrix defining time series of the regional patterns
of contaminant air concentrations by particle size type</LI>

<LI>spatial and temporal matrix defining time series of the regional patterns
of deposition rates by particle size type.</LI>
</OL>

Other output files that the MEPAS atmospheric transport module is required
to produce are the ALS and ERR File:

<OL>
<LI>Create a listing file (*.ALS) using an ASCII format that echoes the input
data and provides intermediate calculations and summary results.</LI>

<LI>Create an Error (*.ERR) File using an ASCII format at the start of the
module execution. If no error occurs during simulation, this file is deleted.
If an error does occur during simulation execution, this file will contain
information on the error that occurred.</LI>
</OL>

<B>6.0 Scientific Requirements for the Atmospheric Transport Module</B>

<P>Mathematical formulations and assumptions for the MEPAS Atmospheric
Transport Module are contained in Droppo and Buck (1996). Some of main
computational functions of the model are

<UL>
<LI>heat-momentum plume rise formulation</LI>

<LI>building wake dispersion formulation.</LI>

<LI>Gaussian sector-average model for annual/seasonal atmospheric transport
and dispersion</LI>

<LI>combined surface layer similarity theory model and empirical wind-tunnel
model for dry deposition</LI>

<LI>in-plume scavenging model for wet deposition</LI>

<LI>surface layer similarity theory model for wind speed adjustments with height.</LI>
</UL>

The MEPAS Atmospheric Transport Module will have the following scientific
requirements:

<OL>
<LI>obey the Law of Mass Conservation</LI>

<LI>simulate both chemicals and radionuclides</LI>

<LI>simulate both particulate and gaseous constituents</LI>

<LI>calculate ground level contaminant air concentrations and deposition rates
by distance and direction using a sector-averaged Gaussian approach for
both area and point sources</LI>

<LI>calculate initial plume rise (both momentum- and buoyancy-dominated) and
building downwash for point sources</LI>

<LI>consider both wet and dry deposition</LI>

<LI>account for near-source local channel (drainage) flow for sites in complex
terrain</LI>

<LI>account for a plume intersection on local terrain heights for elevated
plumes for point sources</LI>

<LI>account for variation in concentration and deposition resulting from varying
surface roughness</LI>

<LI>adjust wind speeds for changes in height between the measurement and release
site</LI>
</OL>

The mathematical formulations documented in Droppo and Buck (1996) provide
more detail on the requirements and design of the MEPAS Atmospheric Transport
Module.
