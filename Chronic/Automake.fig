#=========================================================================
#  Sample AUTOMAKE configuration file (LF90)
#  (lines beginning with a # are comments)
#=========================================================================
#  A simple case consists of 3 lines
#
#    LF90     specifies that we are using Lahey's LF90 (3.50 or later)
#             AUTOMAKE will expect to find an LF90 generated module
#             definition file (modtable.txt)
#    FILES=   to specify the source files (using wild-cards)
#    TARGET=  to specify the executable file name
#=========================================================================

LF90
FILES=*.FOR
TARGET=expos.exe
#COMPILE=@lf90 -c -g -win -trap dio -chk -stchk %fi
COMPILE=@lf90 -c -WIN -trap dio -o2 -chk -stchk %fi
#LINK=@lf90 @%rf -g -win -trap dio -exe %ex -mod %mo
LINK=@lf90 @%rf -win -o2 -exe %ex -mod %mo -bind

#=========================================================================
#  If you use the LF90 keyword, the following COMPILE= and LINK= commands
#  are assumed.  They may be over-ridden as required (by specifying
#  COMPILE= and/or LINK= explicitly).
#  
#  COMPILE=@lf90 -c %fi -mod %mo
#  LINK=@lf90 @%rf -exe %ex -mod %mo
#
#  The following placemarkers may be used in the COMPILE= command
#
#  %sd - the directory containing the source file (includes trailing "\")
#  %sf - the source file name (no directory or extension)
#  %se - the source file extension (includes leading ".")
#  %fi - equivalent to %sd%sf%se
#  %od - the directory containing object files (includes trailing "\")
#                       (specified using OBJDIR=, see below)
#  %oe - the object file extension (includes leading ".")
#                       (specified using OBJEXT=, see below)
#  %id - the INCLUDE file search path
#                       (specified using INCLUDE=, see below)
#  %mo - the name of directory containing modules
#                       (specified using MODULE= - see below)
#  %rf - the name of a response file, created by AUTOMAKE, containing
#        a list of source files.  If %RF is present, the compiler is invoked
#        only once.
#
#  The following placemarkers may be used in the LINK= command
#
#  %ob - expands to the object files corresponding to the source files
#        specified using FILES=.  For example if FILES=*.for, and
#        OBJEXT=.obj (the default), %ob expands to "*.obj".  If there
#        are several compilation phases, %ob combines the object files
#        for all phases.  For example, given
#
#            FILES=*.for 
#            AND
#            FILES=extra\*.for
#
#        %ob expands to "*.obj extra\*.obj"
#
#  %rf - expands to the name of a response file, created by AUTOMAKE
#        containing the names of object files to be linked.
#  %ex - the executable file name as specified using TARGET=
#  %od - as defined for COMPILE=
#  %oe - as defined for COMPILE=
#  %mo - as defined for COMPILE=
#
#  Additional commands may be added as required:
#
#  OBJDIR=    specifies the name of the directory containing object files
#                                         (default same as source files)
#  OBJEXT=    specifies the object file extension         (default .obj)
#  INCLUDE=   specifies a search path for INCLUDE files
#             (e.g.  INCLUDE=;\usr\include;\include)      (default none)
#  MODULE=    specifies the name of the directory containing module files
#                                         (default same as source files)
#
#  Other commands, including QUITONERROR, NOQUITONERROR, MAKEMAKE, DEBUG
#  and CHECK= are described in the manual.
#
#  If the files to be compiled cannot be represented by a single wild-card
#  or if you need a different compiler or different compile options for
#  different files, use the AND keyword to specify different sections.
#
#    e.g.      COMPILE=lf90 -c %fi
#              FILES=fsource\*.for
#                AND
#              COMPILE=cc -c %fi
#              FILES=csource\*.c
#
#  The COMPILE=, OBJEXT=, INCLUDE= and MODULE= keywords may
#  be specified for each phase as necessary. If they are not specified
#  they retain their previous value.  OBJDIR= defaults to the source
#  directory in each section.
