<h3>Probability of Exceedence is a curve that shows the probability of a particular measure (risk, concentration, ...) will occur given the criteria selections made by the user.</h3>

<p><b>Menu Bar:</b>
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The menu bar spans the top portion of the viewer window and provides the user with several standard options
<ul>
<li>Chart: Opens Excel, creating workbooks and charts.</li>
<li>Print: Saves a Tagged Image Format (*.tif) file with a snapshot of the dataset.</li>
<li>Save: Saves a Tab Delimited (*.txt) file with the values from the dataset.</li>
<li>Help: Contains the 'About' and 'How To...' information. The 'About' selection displays the description file of the module.
</ul>

<p><b>Number of Intervals:</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose the number of intervals between the starting and ending time points.
<p><b>De-Minimus:</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The user can choose one of two criteria for De-Minimus values, which specifies how to handle leading and trailing zeroes.
<ul>
<li>All values: no exclusions</li>
<li>Non-zero Values: excludes all but one leading zero and excludes all zeroes after the last non-zero value. This option may modify start and end times.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) Goodness of Fit Test:</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;KS test is used to define confidence intervals surrounding the output results produced by WEAP. The K-S test determines confidence intervals for unknown distribution functions. The probability of an event is obtained from the simulation results by identifying the probability of exceeding the event, thereby defining the distribution function of that event. In the case of time, it is the probability of exceeding a given duration of exposure. The lower and upper limits associated with the empirical distribution are defined as follows:
<ul>
<li>Lower Limit = F<sub>n</sub>(x) - d</li>
<li>Upper Limit = F<sub>n</sub>(x) + d</li>
</ul>
where d is the critical value for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test Statistic, which can be obtained from published tables. The following Confidence Interval pairs are provided as part of the output: 99% &amp; 1%, 95% &amp; 5%, 90% &amp; 10%, 80% &amp; 20%.
<p><b>First and Second Probabilty of Exceedence Bounds:</b>
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;These selections are used to define confidence intervals surrounding the output results produced by the Sensitivity/Uncertainty model. They will determine the probabily of exceeding constituent concentations defined in the Sensitivity/Uncertainty model.

<p><b>Benchmarks File:</b>
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives the user the ability to specify a TREECSBenchmarkInfo XML file containing pathway benchmarks for constituents. If applicable values are found in the file they will appear as horizontal lines on the chart. Values may be omitted from the chart if they exceed the maximum value of the concentration curve and/or confidence intervals by more than 10%.

<p><b>Number of Charts:</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Allows user to make more than one chart at a time, a maximum of 25 charts are possible.

<p><b>Report Details:</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The user can selection a value for each criteria. Some or all of the criteria selections may be present depending on the file type being viewed.
<br/><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Note:  Criteria selections are to be made in descending order as each selection may affect the criteria selections after it.</b>
<br/><br/>
<ul>
<li>Dataset:&nbsp;&nbsp; User can choose the dataset.
<li>Location:&nbsp;&nbsp; User can choose the location.
<li>Age:&nbsp;&nbsp; User can choose the age group.
<li>Constituent:&nbsp;&nbsp; User can choose a single constituent, 'All Chemicals', 'All Radionuclides' or 'All Constituents'.
<li>Measure:&nbsp;&nbsp; User can choose the measure depending upon what is applicable to the file type.
<li>Unit:&nbsp;&nbsp; User can choose the unit depending upon what is applicable to the file type.
<li>Route:&nbsp;&nbsp; User can choose a single route of exposure or 'All'.
<li>Pathway:&nbsp;&nbsp; User can choose a single pathway of exposure or 'All'.
<li>Organ:&nbsp;&nbsp; User can choose a single organ or 'All'.
</ul>

<p><b>Example of Probability of Exceedence User-Interface:</b>
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;(These examples were chosen for their complexity, other viewers may have less criteria selections.)
