<a name=ICBODYWT></a><u><b>IC-BODYWT</b>--The average body weight of individuals for the current exposure location</u>
<br />Units: kilograms
<br />Range: between 1 and 100
<br />
<br />Enter the average body weight for the current exposure location. The MEPAS
user interface will prompt the user to enter the data for each location for the
current transport type. The default value for this parameter is 70 kg
representing the standard man calculation (<a href="#EPA1991">EPA 1991</a>). To
simulate exposure of a child, this parameter can be set to a smaller value, such
as 10 kg. If younger age groups are to be simulated, care must be taken to also
adjust other age dependent parameters, including inhalation rate, exposure
duration and food, water, and soil ingestion rates.

<br />
<br /><a name=ICEXPDUR></a><u><b>IC-EXPDUR</b>--Exposure duration for individuals at the current usage location</u>
<br />Units: years
<br />Range: between 1 and 100
<br />
<br />Enter the exposure duration for individuals being described for the current
usage location. As an example of the use of the two parameters defined in this screen,
consider the estimation of risk from soil ingestion to a young child for the
period of 1 to 6 years of age (inclusive) for measured soil concentrations. The
exposure duration is 6 years and the average weight for this age is 15 kg. The
parameters are set as follows:
<br /><center>IC-BODYWT = 15 kg, IC-EXPDUR = 6 yrs</center>
<br />A soil ingestion rate of 200 mg/d or 0.2 g/d is recommended by EPA for this
age group. The soil ingestion rate is set in the 'Customize' screen on the
'soil' tab, parameter 'soil ingestion rate'. Use of these parameter values will
provide an estimate of risk to young children for soil ingestion of
chemicals. Note that the International Commission on Radiological
Protection (ICRP) dose factors and EPA slope factors are primarily based on
exposure to adults and thus can not be used to estimate risk to young children
from exposure to radionuclides.

<br />
<br /><a name=ICDERM></a><u><b>IC-DERM</b>--Water dermal absorption model</u>
<br />
<br />This pull-down menu box allows selection of the method to estimate intake by
dermal absorption. Two methods are available: the EPA dermal absorption
model or the linear model. The EPA dermal absorption model may be used
for organic chemicals that have a value defined for octanol-water partition
coefficient. If no value is available for octanol-water partition
coefficient, then the linear model is used. The linear model is also used
for all inorganic chemicals and radionuclides, no matter which option is
selected here.

<br />
<br /><a name=IGUDWGW></a><a name=GROUNDWATER></a><u><b>IG-UDWGW</b>--Drinking water ingestion rate of ground water</u>
<br />Units: liters per day (L/d)
<br />Range: 0.0 to 10.0
<br />Default Value: 1.4
<br />
<br />The daily water ingestion by the exposed individual represents the water
intake from all used of domestic water. The intake includes drinking
water, use of water in cooking, and use of water to prepare beverages (coffee,
tea, reconstituted juices, etc.). The default value is based on
recommendations of the (<a href="#EPA1997_V1">EPA 1997 (Vol.1)</a>).

<br />
<br /><a name=IWUDWSW></a><u><b>IW-UDWSW</b>--Drinking water ingestion rate of surface water</u>
<br />Units: liters per day (L/d)
<br />Range: 0.0 to 10.0
<br />Default Value: 1.4
<br />
<br />The daily water ingestion by the exposed individual represents the water
intake from all uses of domestic water. The intake includes drinking
water, use of water in cooking, and use of water to prepare beverages (coffee,
tea, reconstituted juices, etc.). The default value is based on
recommendations of the (<a href="#EPA1997_V1">EPA 1997 (Vol.1)</a>).

<br />
<br /><a name=ICTAGE1></a><u><b>IC-TAGE1</b>--Age of receptor at start of exposure</u>
<br />Units: yr
<br />Range: 0.0 to 100
<br />Default Value: 0 (<a href="#EPA1991">EPA 1991</a>)
<br />
<br />The parameters TAGE1 and TAGE2 are used to specify the age range of the
exposed individual. TAGE1 being the lower age range limit and TAGE2 being
the upper age range limit. This is useful if an assessment is being
performed to address the impacts to a specific age group. For example, if
an industrial usage scenario is being modeled, the user may want to specify
that only 25 to 55 year olds will be exposed. In this case, TAGE1 would
be 25 and TAGE2 would be 55.

<br />
<br /><a name=ICTAGE2></a><u><b>IC-TAGE2</b>--Age of receptor at end of exposure</u>
<br />Units: yr
<br />Range: TAGE1 + 1 to 100
<br />Default Value: 70 (<a href="#EPA1991">EPA 1991</a>)
<br />
<br />The parameters TAGE1 and TAGE2 are used to specify the age range of the
exposed individual. TAGE1 being the lower age range limit and TAGE2 being
the upper age range limit. This is useful if an assessment is being
performed to address the impacts to a specific age group. For example, if
an industrial usage scenario is being modeled, the user may want to specify
that only 25 to 55 year olds will be exposed. In this case, TAGE1 would
be 25 and TAGE2 would be 55.

<br />
<br /><a name=HEINHAL></a><u><b>HE-INHAL</b>--Selection Index for Inhalation Impact Analysis</u>
<br />Units: none
<br />Range: &quot;average daily intake&quot; or &quot;air concentration&quot;
<br />Default Value: &quot;air concentration&quot;
<br />
<br />The parameter INHAL is used to select the method for evaluation of human
impacts from inhalation exposure pathways. There are two options: average
daily intake or air concentration. When average daily intake is selected
the health impacts are to be based on the average daily intake rate (mg/kg/day)
and either the inhalation slope factor for carcinogenic chemicals or the
inhalation reference dose for other chemicals. When &quot;air
concentration&quot; is selected, the health impacts are to be based on the air
concentration (mg/m^3) at the exposure location and either the inhalation unit
risk factor or the inhalation reference concentration. Use of this
parameter must be coordinated with the model selected under the health impacts
component. When the MEPAS components are used for both the receptor and
impacts analysis, non-zero results for chemicals will only be obtained for
inhalation if the selection flags agree (i.e., both &quot;average daily
intake&quot; or both &quot;air concentration&quot;.

<br /><a name="EXTERNAL_GROUND"></a><h2>EXTERNAL GROUND DOSE TAB</h2>
The shielding factors and time fractions for indoor and outdoor activities
are used to estimate the external dose from ground contamination. This
allows the user to apply appropriate shielding corrections for the type of
dwelling under consideration. The shielding factor is multiplied by the
unshielded dose rate to obtain the dose rate for the activity (indoors or
outdoors). The time fractions indicate the relative amount of time the
individual spends indoors and outdoors. The default value for shielding
factor outdoors (1.0) represents no reduction in dose rate.

<br />Units: cubic meters per day (m<sup>3</sup>/d)
<br />Range: 0.0 to 50.0
<br />Default Value: 15.2
<br />
<br />The inhalation rate while showering is used to estimate inhalation intake
from volatile pollutants released from domestic water. The inhalation
rate represents the rate of inhalation during a shower (when the MEPAS shower
inhalation model is selected) or the daily intake of indoor air (when the

pathway frequency parameters (e.g. EVSHWR and shower exposure frequency).&nbsp;
The specific pathway frequency parameters are generally used to represent the
number exposure events during a day in which exposure occurs. For example
if an individual showers 2 times in each of the 350 days of exposure, the
shower frequency factor (EVSHWR) would be set to 2. Note, however, that
the default values are set to 1 (exposure every day during a year) and the

<br /><a name=ICUSW></a><u><b>IC-USW</b>--Water ingestion rate while swimming</u>
<br />Units: liters per hour (L/hr)
<br />Range: 0.0 to 1.0
<br />
<br />Individuals swimming are subject to inadvertently ingest small amounts of
water. The ingestion is defined as the amount ingested per hour of
swimming activity. The total intake (per swimming event) is calculated by
MEPAS as the product of the ingestion rate and the swimming exposure duration.

<br />
<br /><a name=ICTESWIM></a><u><b>IC-TESWIM</b>--Duration of a swimming event</u>
<br />Units: hours per event (hr/event)
<br />Range: 0.0 to 24.0
<br />Default Value: 1.0
<br />
<br />Individuals involved in swimming are potentially exposed from dermal contact
with the water, inadvertent ingestion of water while swimming, and by external
exposure to radionuclides in the water. These pathway require an estimate
of the duration of contact with the water. The default value, when
multiplied by the annual average default swimming frequency gives a daily
average exposure time of 0.033 hr. This value is equivalent to the
recommended annual average exposure time of 12 hours (<a href="#EPA1997_V3">EPA
1997 (Vol.3)</a>).

<br />Units: events per day (events/d)
<br />Range: 0.0 to 5.0
<br />Default Value: 0.033
<br />
<br />The swimming frequency gives the number of swimming events per day for the
exposed individual. The value used for this parameter must be coordinated
with the value use for the annual factor. The default value is set to
0.066 to give an annual average exposure time of 12 hours as recommended by (<a

<h2>MEPAS Receptor Intake Model Undocumented Equations</h2>


<b>Skin Permeability Constant Estimation</b>
<br />
<br />A positive value for skin permeability constant is always generated at run
time by the MEPAS Receptor Intake module.
The method used depends on the type of constituent. For organic chemicals, the correlation is
from the EPA handbook on Dermal Exposure Assessment: Principles and
Applications (1992). A constituent is
determined to be organic and use of the correlation method is considered
appropriate if input values for molecular weight and Kow are both
positive. If these conditions are met,
then the following correlation is used.
<br />
<br />Pk = -2.72 + 0.71* Log10(Kow) - 0.0061 * MW
<br />
<br />Where
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pk = skinpermeability constant (cm/hr)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kow = octanol-water partition coefficient(dimensionless)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MW = molecularweight of the constituent.
<br />
<br />If the constituent is not organic, and the above conditionson Kow and
molecular weight are not met, then the skin permeability is set to0.001 cm/hr
(EPA 1992).

<br />
<br /><b>Indoor Air Model Parameters</b>
<br />
<br />The EPA indoor air model used water to indoor air transferfactors for
volatile chemicals (ANDFC), radon (ANDFR), and all other chemicalsand
radionuclides (ANDFO). These
