<b>GENII Receptor Intake User Interface</b>
<p>This user interface allows the user to specify the number of age groups
to be considered, and parameters necessary to estimate the intake or exposure
to radionuclides.&nbsp; The single screen for this user interface has three
divisions:&nbsp; 1) <a href="#NAGES">number of age groups</a> (upper left),
2) <a href="#AGESEL">age group</a> and <a href="#PATHSEL">exposure pathway</a>
selection (lower left), and 3) <a href="#INPUT">parameter value entry</a>
for the selected age group and exposure pathway (right).
<p><a NAME="NAGES"></a><b>Number of Age Groups</b>
<p>The <u>number of age groups</u> is set to the number of age groups to
be evaluated in the current intake assessment.&nbsp; Most parameters to
be provided are a function of age.&nbsp; A maximum of 6 groups can be defined.
<p><a NAME="AGESEL"></a><b>Age Group and Exposure Pathway Selection</b>
<p>The <u>age group selection</u> pull-down box is used to identify the
age group associated with input parameters to be entered.&nbsp; Values
for all parameters should be entered for all of the <a href="#NAGES">number
of age groups</a> defined.
<p><a NAME="EDAGE"></a>The<u> lower bound</u> is the minimum age for a
person in the currently <a href="#NAGES">selected age group</a> .&nbsp;
Only integer years are supported.
<p><a NAME="POPAGE"></a>The <u>upper bound </u>is the maximum age for a
person in the currently selected <a href="#NAGES">selected age group</a>
.&nbsp; It must be larger than the <a href="#EDAGE">lower bound. 
</a>Only
integer years are supported.
<p><a NAME="PATHSEL"></a>The <u>exposure pathway selection</u> pull-down
list allows the user to select the exposure pathway for which parameters
are to be entered.&nbsp; A specific pathway is selected by clicking on
the desired pathway, or by scrolling up or down using the arrow keys on
the keyboard.&nbsp; The paramters are entered in the input area on the
right side of the screen.
<p><a NAME="INPUT"></a>The right side of the screen is used for <u>parameter
value entry</u>.&nbsp; The parameters displayed for entry correspond to
the exposure pathway and age group selected.&nbsp; For the three swimming
pathways (external, ingestion, and dermal) all parameters are display when
any of the pathways is selected.&nbsp; The same is true for the two shoreline
pathways (external and dermal).&nbsp; The parametes for each exposure pathway
are described below in the order in which the pathways appear in the exposure
pathway pull-down list.
