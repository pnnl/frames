<a name="WPCLASS"></a><u><b>WP-CLASS</b>--Partially saturated zone soil texual classification</u>
<br />Units: none
<br />
<br />The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) soil textural
classification scheme is used by the MEPAS modules. This scheme is
based on the relative proportions of sand, silt and clay by weight normalized
to 100 percent. Refer to site documents to determine an appropriate
soil textural classification.
<br />
<br />Selecting a soil texture results in the assignment of
default values for percent sand (<a href="#WPSAND">WP-SAND</a>), percent
silt (<a href="#WPSILT">WP-SILT</a>), percent clay (<a href="#WPCLAY">WP-CLAY</a>),
percent organic matter (<a href="#WPOMC">WP-OMC</a>), and percent iron
and aluminum (<a href="#WPIRON">WP-IRON</a>). If "Autofill" is enabled
(i.e., checked) under the "Options" menu, default values are also assigned
for soil type coefficient (<a href="#WPSOILCOEF">WP-SOILCOEF</a>), total
porosity (<a href="VAD.HTM#WPTOTPOR">WP-TOTPOR</a>), field capacity (<a href="#WPFIELDC">WP-FIELDC</a>),
saturated hydraulic conductivity (<a href="#WPCONDUC">WP-CONDUC</a>), and
dry bulk density (<a href="#WPBULKD">WP-BULKD</a>). The default values
are the same as those listed in <a href="TAB_2_1.HTM">Table 2.1</a>.
These assignments are not necessarily permanent - they can be changed to
site specific values at any time.
<br />
<br /><a name="WPSAND"></a><u><b>WP-SAND</b>--Percent sand of partially saturated zone</u>
<br />Units: percent (%)
<br />Range: 0 to 100
<br />
<br />If the percentage of sand is not available from site
documents, a typical value can be selected from <a href="TAB_2_1.HTM">Table
2.1</a> for the soil textural classification determined in Section <a href="#WPCLASS">WP-CLASS</a>
above. The percentage of sand is only used
for the estimation of subsurface adsorption coefficients (<a href="#WASUBKD">WA-SUBKD</a>)
for organic constituents. The sum of
percent sand (<a href="#WPSAND">WP-SAND</a>), percent silt (<a href="#WPSILT">WP-SILT</a>),
percent clay (<a href="#WPCLAY">WP-CLAY</a>), percent organic matter (<a href="#WPOMC">WP-OMC</a>),
and percent iron and aluminum (<a href="#WPIRON">WP-IRON</a>) must be 100.
<br />
<br /><a name="WPSILT"></a><u><b>WP-SILT</b>--Percent silt of partially saturated zone</u>
<br />Units: percent (%)
<br />Range: 0 to 100
<br />
<br />If the percentage of silt is not available from site
documents, a typical value can be selected from <a href="TAB_2_1.HTM">Table
2.1</a> for the soil textural classification determined in Section <a href="#WPCLASS">WP-CLASS</a>
above. The percentage of silt is only used
for the estimation of subsurface adsorption coefficients (<a href="#WASUBKD">WA-SUBKD</a>)
for organic constituents. The sum of

percent clay (<a href="#WPCLAY">WP-CLAY</a>), percent organic matter (<a href="#WPOMC">WP-OMC</a>),
and percent iron and aluminum (<a href="#WPIRON">WP-IRON</a>) must be 100.
<br />
<br /><a name="WPCLAY"></a><u><b>WP-CLAY</b>--Percent clay of partially saturated zone</u>
<br />Units: percent (%)
<br />Range: 0 to 100
<br />
<br />If the percentage of clay is not available from site
documents, a typical value can be selected from <a href="TAB_2_1.HTM">Table
2.1</a> for the soil textural classification determined in Section <a href="#WPCLASS">WP-CLASS</a>
above. The percentage of clay is only used
for the estimation of subsurface adsorption coefficients (<a href="#WASUBKD">WA-SUBKD</a>)
for both organic and inorganic constituents.
The sum of percent sand (<a href="#WPSAND">WP-SAND</a>), percent silt (<a href="#WPSILT">WP-SILT</a>),
percent clay (<a href="#WPCLAY">WP-CLAY</a>), percent organic matter (<a href="#WPOMC">WP-OMC</a>),
and percent iron and aluminum (<a href="#WPIRON">WP-IRON</a>) must be 100.
<br />
<br /><a name="WPOMC"></a><u><b>WP-OMC</b>--Percent organic matter content of partially saturated zone</u>
<br />Units: percent (%)
<br />Range: 0 to 100
<br />
<br />Obtain the percentage of organic matter from site documents,
if possible. Often times, the fraction of organic carbon (f<sub>oc</sub>)
will be available. Since the carbon content of organic matter in
environmental systems is generally about 58 percent, the percentage of
organic matter can be estimated from the fraction of organic carbon as
follows:
<br />
<br />
<center>Organic Matter (%) = 1.7 x (Fraction Organic Carbon) x 100 (%)</center>
<br />If the percentage of organic matter is not available
from site documents and cannot otherwise be determined, assume it is zero.
<br />
<br />The percentage of organic matter
is only used for the estimation of subsurface adsorption coefficients
(<a href="#WASUBKD">WA-SUBKD</a>) for organic constituents.
The sum of percent sand (<a href="#WPSAND">WP-SAND</a>), percent silt (<a href="#WPSILT">WP-SILT</a>),
percent clay (<a href="#WPCLAY">WP-CLAY</a>), percent organic matter (<a href="#WPOMC">WP-OMC</a>),
and percent iron and aluminum (<a href="#WPIRON">WP-IRON</a>) must be 100.
<br />
<br /><a name="WPIRON"></a><u><b>WP-IRON</b>--Percent iron and aluminum in partially saturated zone</u>
<br />Units: percent (%)
<br />Range: 0 to 100
<br />
<br />If the percentage of iron and aluminum is not available
from site documents, assume it is zero. The
percentage of iron and aluminum is only used for the estimation of subsurface
adsorption coefficients (<a href="#WASUBKD">WA-SUBKD</a>) for
inorganic constituents. The sum of percent sand (<a href="#WPSAND">WP-SAND</a>),
percent silt (<a href="#WPSILT">WP-SILT</a>), percent clay (<a href="#WPCLAY">WP-CLAY</a>),
percent organic matter (<a href="#WPOMC">WP-OMC</a>), and percent iron
and aluminum (<a href="#WPIRON">WP-IRON</a>) must be 100.
<br />
<br /><a name="WPSOILCOEF"></a><u><b>WP-SOILCOEF</b>--Soil type coefficient</u>
<br />Units: none
<br />Range: 0 to 15
<br />
<br />This is an empirically determined coefficient in an equation
relating unsaturated hydraulic conductivity to soil moisture content.
Unless a measured value is available, use the values from <a href="TAB_2_1.HTM">Table
2.1</a> for the appropriate soil-textural classification determined in
Section <a href="#WPCLASS">WP-CLASS</a>. See the following document
for the equation in which this coefficient is used:

<a name="CHARACTERISTICS"></a><h2>SOIL CHARACTERISTICS TAB</h2>

<a name="WPPH"></a><u><b>WP-PH</b>--pH of pore water in the partially saturated zone</u>
<br />Units: none
<br />Range: 1 to 14
<br />
<br />If pH is unavailable from site documents, use pH = 7 (i.e., neutral conditions).
The pH is only used for the estimation of subsurface adsorption coefficients
(<a href="#WASUBKD">WA-SUBKD</a>) for inorganic constituents.
<br />
<br /><a name="WPTOTPOR"></a><u><b>WP-TOTPOR</b>--Total porosity of partially saturated zone</u>
<br />Units: percent (%)
<br />Range: 0.1 to 99.9
<br />
<br />If total porosity is not available for the partially
saturated zone, use the values from <a href="TAB_2_1.HTM">Table 2.1</a>
for the appropriate soil-textural classification determined in Section
<a href="#WPCLASS">WP-CLASS</a>. If you must choose between two categories,
choose an average value. This value should correlate to the dry bulk
density identified in Section <a href="VAD.HTM#WPBULKD">WP-BULKD</a> as
follows:
<br />
<br />
<center>Porosity = 1 - (Dry Bulk Density/Specific Weight)</center>
<br />If the specific weight is unknown, it can be approximated as 2.65 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.
<br /><sup></sup>
<br /><a name="WPFIELDC"></a><u><b>WP-FIELDC</b>--Field capacity of partially saturated zone</u>
<br />Units: percent (%)
<br />Range: 0.1 to WP-TOTPOR
<br />
<br />If a field capacity is not available for the partially
saturated zone, use the typical value from <a href="TAB_2_1.HTM">Table
2.1</a> for the appropriate textural classification determined in Section
<a href="#WPCLASS">WP-CLASS</a>. Field capacity must be less than
or equal to total porosity (<a href="VAD.HTM#WPTOTPOR">WP-TOTPOR</a>).
Field capacity is used as a lower limit on the moisture content calculation
by the vadose zone module.
<br />
<br /><a name="WPCONDUC"></a><u><b>WP-CONDUC</b>--Saturated hydraulic conductivity</u>
<br />Units: centimeters per day (cm/day)
<br />Range: greater than 0.0
<br />
<br />Use a site-specific value, if available. Otherwise,
select a value from <a href="TAB_2_1.HTM">Table 2.1</a> for the appropriate
soil-textural classification determined in Section <a href="#WPCLASS">WP-CLASS</a>.
Saturated hydraulic conductivity is used in the moisture content calculation
by the vadose zone module.
<br />
<br /><a name="WPTHICK"></a><u><b>WP-THICK</b>--Thickness of partially saturated zone</u>
<br />Units: centimeters (cm)
<br />Range: 0.1 to 304,800
<br />
<br />Determine the number of distinct geologic layers in the
unsaturated zone beneath the waste site, and represent each one using a
separate glyph (i.e., partially saturated zone icon) in the FRAMES conceptual
model diagram. Minimize the number of layers by requiring each layer
to have very distinct or different characteristics (percent sand, silt,
and clay). If you are uncertain about distinguishing between one
or two layers, make one and use the more conservative parameters (i.e.,
use the parameters yielding the fastest travel time for constituent passing
through the zone). Layers must be continuous beneath the site as
the model does not simulate partial layers.
<br />
<br />The example cross-sectional system illustrated in <a href="FIG_2_20.HTM">Figure
2.20</a> can be simplified into five layers represented by G1 through G5.
Layers L1, L2, and L3 are not treated as layers because they are discontinuous.
Sandy aquifers S1, S2, and S3 can be combined into a single aquifer whose
physical properties are based on a weighted average of the individual layers.
Try to keep the number of layers at a site to five or less.
<br />
<br />The thickness of each major, distinct geologic layer
should be obtained from site data, such as well logs or fence diagrams.
The total thickness of all layers must equal the thickness of the unsaturated
zone (distance from the bottom of the waste pit, pond, or landfill to the
water table). If a clay or admix liner is present, it constitutes
a layer.
<br />
<br /><a name="WPLDISP"></a><u><b>WP-LDISP</b>--Longitudinal dispersivity of partially saturated zone</u>
<br />Units: centimeters (cm)
<br />Range: greater than 0.0 and less than WP-THICK
<br />
<br />Enter the longitudinal dispersivity for the layer from
site documents.
The following equation is used for the estimate:
<br />
<br />
<center>D<sub>L</sub> = 0.01 (WP-THICK)</center>
<br />where D<sub>L</sub> is the longitudinal dispersivity
and <a href="VAD.HTM#WPTHICK">WP-THICK</a> is the thickness of the partially
saturated layer.
<br />
<br /><a name="WPBULKD"></a><u><b>WP-BULKD</b>--Dry bulk density of partially saturated zone</u>
<br />Units: grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm<sup>3</sup>)
<br />Range: 1.00 to 3.00
<br />Typical environmental range: See Table 2.1
<br />
<br />If a dry bulk density value is not available from site
documents, typical values may be selected from <a href="TAB_2_1.HTM">Table
2.1</a> for the appropriate soil-textural classification determined in
Section <a href="#WPCLASS">WP-CLASS</a>. If you are uncertain which
of two values to choose, use the smallest value to be conservative.
This value should correlate to the total porosity identified in Section
<a href="VAD.HTM#WPTOTPOR">WP-TOTPOR</a>.

<a name="PROPERTIES"></a><h2>CONSTITUENT PROPERTIES TAB</h2>
<a name="FSCNAME"></a><u><b>FS-CNAME</b>--Name of constituent(s) for current transport scenario</u>
<br />
<br />This field shows the constituents that are selected for
the scenario. Use the arrow buttons to scroll through the list of
constituents and enter an adsorption coefficient and water solubility for
each one, and a degradation/decay half-life for non-radionuclides.
If a constituent has decay products, they will be shown on the bottom part
of this screen.
<br />
<br /><a name="WASUBKD"></a><u><b>WA-SUBKD</b>--Subsurface adsorption coefficients</u>
<br />Units: milliliters per gram (ml/g)
<br />Range: greater than or equal to 0.0
<br />
<br />WA-SURFKD represents the equilibrium (partition or distribution)
coefficient (K<sub>d</sub>) of constituent between the soil particles and
the soil moisture. Use laboratory or field-derived K<sub>d</sub>
values if they are available from site documents or reports of studies
using similar soil and constituent characteristics. Theoretically, K<sub>d</sub> is defined as:
<br />
<br/><center>K<sub>d</sub> = C<sub>p</sub>/C<sub>d</sub></center>
<br />
where C<sub>p</sub> is the particulate concentration
(i.e., weight or activity of adsorbed constituent per weight of solid)
and C<sub>d</sub> is the dissolved concentration or activity. Although
the K<sub>d</sub> value of a constituent of concern can be determined in
the laboratory or obtained from published literature, such values can vary
considerably depending upon the experimental or environmental conditions
(e.g., characteristics of soil and water) and technique used. When
choosing between K<sub>d</sub> values, use the value which will provide
the conservative results (e.g., highest risk). For example, a receptor
who is living on or near the waste site and ingesting contaminated soil
would have high risk with the large K<sub>d</sub> value because the constituent
would not be readily leached from the soil and would be retained in soils
for an extended period of time. On the other hand, low K<sub>d</sub>
value would pose a high risk to the offsite receptor who ingests water
because the constituent is readily dissolved into water and mobilized.
Note that because of the uncertainty associated with K<sub>d</sub>, it
is preferably used as a calibration parameter to adjust the constituent
velocity.
<br />
<br /><b>Selecting Adsoption Coefficient</b> - The vadose zone module can provide estimates of K<sub>d</sub>
for all constituents. For inorganic constituents, typical K<sub>d</sub>
values reported in the peer reviewed literature are provided by the user
interface, via a lookup table, based on the soil water pH (<a href="#WPPH">WP-PH</a>), percent
clay (<a href="#WPCLAY">WP-CLAY</a>) and percent iron and aluminum (<a href="#WPIRON">WP-IRON</a>).
For organic constituents, the percent sand (<a href="#WPSAND">WP-SAND</a>),
percent silt (<a href="#WPSILT">WP-SILT</a>), percent clay (<a href="#WPCLAY">WP-CLAY</a>),
and percent organic matter (<a href="#WPOMC">WP-OMC</a>) are used in an
empirical equation to provide a K<sub>d</sub> estimate.
<br />The dropdown box gives the user the choice to select a K<sub>d</sub> from

<br /><a name="WPSOL"></a><u><b>WP-SOL</b>--Water solubility</u>
<br />Units: milligrams per liter (mg/l) or picocuries per milliliter (pCi/ml)
<br />Range: greater than or equal to 0.0
<br />
<br />Enter the aqueous solubility for the constituent.
For most organic constituents, this value is available in the constituent
database or in chemical property books. For inorganic constituents,
this value will have to be estimated based on the geochemistry of the waste
zone. If a value is available in the constituent database, it will
be used as an initial default value. If a database value is not available,
the solubility is set to 0, which is used as an indicator meaning an unknown
solubility. The vadose zone module only uses the water solubility
for a comparison with the concentration of constituent entering the layer.
If that concentration exceeds the solubility, a warning message is written
to a warning message file (<I>casename</I>.WRN). If the solubility
is 0, this comparision is not performed.
<br />
<br /><a name="WPGHALF"></a><u><b>WP-GHALF</b>--Half-life in ground water</u>
<br />Units: years
<br />Range: greater than 0.0
<br />
<br />This parameter is the half-life of the constituent
in the aquifer. For radionuclide and non-radionuclide constituents, this value defaults to
the data in the constituent database, but the value can be changed to a site-specific value.
This parameter can be used to implement other degradation rates (e.g., biodegradation, photo
degradation, etc...) when they are converted to equivalent half-lives.
