<br /><a name="WWVELOC"></a><u><b>WW-VELOC</b>--Flow velocity at constituent entry point</u>
<br />Units: feet per second (m/s)
<br />Range: greater than 0.0
<br />
<br />The river flow velocity should be determined for the
location where constituents from the release site enter the river.
The river flow velocity is based on the average annual stream discharge.
Depending on the data available, the flow velocity can be estimated in
a number of ways. The following techniques are suggested, in order
of preference:
<br />
<blockquote>
1. Published information: If the average annual flow
velocity has been published for the stream or river, use this value.
<br />
<br />2. USGS Water Resources Data Report or USACOE Stage-Discharge
Reports, and Discharge Summary Measurement Sheets: the first step (1) is
to locate the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gaging station that is closest
to the facility and within the reach of the river of interest. The gaging
station can be identified from the USGS Water Resources Data reports for
the appropriate states or from stage and discharge reports for selected
rivers published by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (<a href="FIG_2_25.HTM">Figure
2.25</a>). An example map showing locations of USGS gaging stations
is presented in <a href="FIG_2_26.HTM">Figure 2.26</a>. From these
reports, water-discharge records are available for each of the gaging stations.
USGS gaging stations are also available via the internet (http://water.usgs.gov/).
<br />
<br />The second step (2) is to obtain the average annual discharge
from a table similar to the example shown in <a href="FIG_2_27.HTM">Figure
2.27</a>. The average annual discharge is listed under the heading titled
"Average Discharge" on the USGS Water Resources Data Report
(see <a href="FIG_2_27.HTM">Figure 2.27</a>).
USGS discharge data is also available via the internet (http://water.usgs.gov/).
<br />
<br />The third step (3) is to develop a relationship between
velocity and discharge, which can be determined from data in the USGS Discharge
Measurement Summary Sheets; i.e., Form 9-207 (<a href="FIG_2_28.HTM">Figure
2.28</a>). Correlated pairs of discharge and mean flow velocity data
are available from Form 9-207. Form 9-207 is associated with each
station; it describes the width, cross-sectional area, height, and flow
velocity for various discharges. Using data from this form and the
other reports, velocity versus discharge, depth versus discharge, and/or
width versus discharge can be plotted on log-log graph in a spreadsheet.
Example plots of velocity versus discharge and width versus discharge are
illustrated in <a href="FIG_2_29.HTM">Figure 2.29</a>. The points
plotted may be somewhat scattered; a best-fit curve will have to be estimated.
<br />
<br />3. USGS Water Resources Data Report or USACOE Stage-Discharge
Reports, and USGS 7.5' Topographic Maps: If Discharge Summary Measurement
Sheets (i.e., Form 9-207) for a gage (within the reach of the river that
is of interest) is unavailable, the average flow velocity can be calculated
using an USGS Water Resources Data Report or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(USACOE) Stage-Discharge Reports, field data, and/or USGS 7.5-min topographic
maps. In this case, the average annual velocity is estimated using
the average annual discharge, flow width, and flow depth in the following
equation:
<br />
<br />
<center>Flow Velocity = Average Annual Discharge/Flow Depth/Flow Width</center>
<br />The average annual discharge is obtained as described
above in Step 2. The flow width and depth can be measured during
site visit(s) or estimated with the help of someone who has visited the
site. If field measurements of the depth are unavailable, the depth
can be estimated as follows. The USGS topographic maps can be used
to locate the gaging station and estimate the bed elevation of the stream
at that location. The USGS or USACOE reports are used to identify
gage height versus discharge. To convert gage height to flow depth
for flow depth-discharge plots (<a href="FIG_2_29.HTM">Figure 2.29</a>),
use the following equation:
<br />
<br />
<center>Flow Depth = Gage Elevation + Gage Height - Bed Elevation</center>
<br />The elevation of the gage can usually be obtained from
the USGS or USACOE report under the heading "Gage." The gage height
is recorded for various discharges in these reports. The bed elevation
is obtained from the USGS topographic map. The flow depths and the
discharges can be plotted on a log-log graph which is similar to one illustrated
in <a href="FIG_2_29.HTM">Figure 2.29</a>. The flow depth corresponding
to the average annual discharge can be obtained from this plot.
<br />
<br />4. Site Inspection: If some of the recorded information
is unavailable for the stream in question, a site visit may be required,
or correspondence with appropriate government agencies may be appropriate.
<br />
<br />5. First available gaging station: If no information is
available, use data from the first gaging station downstream.</UL>

<a name="WWDEPTH"></a><u><b>WW-DEPTH</b>--Depth at constituent entry point</u>
<br />Units: feet (m)
<br />Range: greater than 0.0
<br />
<br />The river flow velocity should be determined for the
location where constituents from the release site enter the river.
An analogous procedure as that outlined in Section <a href="RIV.HTM#WWVELOC">WW-VELOC</a>
can be used. In step (3), use flow depth from Form 9-207 and plot
flow depth versus discharge.
<br />
<br /><a name="WWWIDTH"></a><u><b>WW-WIDTH</b>--Width at constituent entry point</u>
<br />Units: feet (m)
<br />Range: greater than 0.0
<br />
<br />The river flow velocity should be determined for the
location where constituents from the release site enter the river.
An analogous procedure as that outlined in Section <a href="RIV.HTM#WWVELOC">WW-VELOC</a>
can be used. In step (3), use flow width from Form 9-207 and plot
flow width versus discharge (see <a href="Fig_2_29.htm">Figure 2.29</a>).
<br />
<br /><a name="WWDIST"></a><u><b>WW-DIST</b>--Distance from source to location</u>
<br />Units: feet (m)
<br />Range: greater than or equal to 0.0
<br />
<br />Identify the distance from the surface-water source to
the downstream usage location from the USGS topographic maps. A usage
location is where water is withdrawn from the river for domestic or agricultural
uses or where receptors are directly exposed to river water. Usage
locations are always assumed to be on the same side of the river as the
constituent source entering the river. Identify the distance from
the <u>center</u> of the source entering the river to the downstream usage
locations. <a href="FIG_2_30.HTM">Figures 2.30</a> and <a href="FIG_2_31.HTM">2.31</a>
present examples that illustrate WW-DIST: 1) downstream receptor (e.g.,
water intake structure) is located near the river source or on the straight
river, and 2) it is on the meandering river, respectively.
<br />
<br /><a name="WWDISCHG"></a><u><b>WW-DISCHG</b>--Average annual discharge at location</u>
<br />Units: cubic feet per second (m<sup>3</sup>/s)
<br />Range: greater than 0.0
<br />
<br />Discharge is a function of distance and may change from
one usage location to the next. To determine the average annual discharge,
follow the guidelines outlined in <a href="RIV.HTM#WWVELOC">WW-VELOC</a>.
If a usage location lies between two gaging stations, interpolate linearly
to estimate the discharge. Note that the discharge is not necessarily
the same as that used to determine the flow velocity, river depth, or river
width where constituents enter the river (<a href="RIV.HTM#WWVELOC">WW-VELOC</a>,
<a href="RIV.HTM#WWDEPTH">WW-DEPTH</a>, or <a href="RIV.HTM#WWWIDTH">WW-WIDTH</a>).

<br />A mapable northing coordinate.  When combined with the easting coordinate,
the coordinate pair shall represent a point on a map where the surface water
concentrations are located. It is assume that the user will supply all
coordinates on the same basis, such as Nad87, UTM zone 11.  This value is not
used to compute the concentrations.

<br />Units: meters (m)
<br />Range: real number
<br />
<br />A mapable easting coordinate.  When combined with the northing, the coordinate
pair shall represent a point on a map where the surface water concentrations are located.
It is assume that the user will supply all coordinates on the same basis, such as Nad87,
UTM zone 11.  This value is not used to compute the concentrations.
<br />
<br /><a name="WWY"></a><u><b>WW-Z</b>--Elevation</u>
<br />Units: meters (m)
<br />Range: real number, probably greater than zero.
<br />
<br />The elevation at the point represented by northing and easting coordinate pair.
This value is not used to compute the concentrations.

<a name="PROPERTIES"></a><h2>CONSTITUENT PROPERTIES TAB</h2>
<a name="FSCNAME"></a><u><b>FS-CNAME</b>--Name of constituent(s) for current transport scenario</u>
<br />
<br />This field shows the constituents that are selected for
the scenario. Use the arrow buttons to scroll through the list of
constituents and enter an adsorption coefficient and water solubility for
each one, and a degradation/decay half-life for non-radionuclides.
If a constituent has decay products, they will be shown on the bottom part
of this screen.
<br />
<br /><a name="WWSOL"></a><u><b>WW-SOL</b>--Water solubility</u>
<br />Units: milligrams per liter (mg/l) or picocuries per milliliter (pCi/ml)
<br />Range: greater than or equal to 0.0
<br />
<br />Enter the aqueous solubility for the constituent.
For most organic constituents, this value is available in the constituent
database or in chemical property books. For inorganic constituents,
this value will have to be estimated based on the geochemistry of the waste
zone. If a value is available in the constituent database, it will
be used as an initial default value. If a database value is not available,
the solubility is set to 0, which is used as an indicator meaning an unknown
solubility. The vadose zone module only uses the water solubility
for a comparison with the concentration of constituent entering the layer.
If that concentration exceeds the solubility, a warning message is written
to a warning message file (<I>casename</I>.WRN). If the solubility
is 0, this comparision is not performed.
<br />
<br /><a name="WWSHALF"></a><u><b>WW-SHALF</b>--Half-life in surface water</u>
<br />Units: years
<br />Range: greater than 0.0
<br />
<br />This parameter is the half-life of the constituent
in the aquifer. For radionuclide and non-radionuclide constituents, this value defaults to
the data in the constituent database, but the value can be changed to a site-specific value.
This parameter can be used to implement other degradation rates (e.g., biodegradation, photo
degradation, etc...) when they are converted to equivalent half-lives.
