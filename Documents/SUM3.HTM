<a name="VAR"></A>
<H2>Alias Input Variables</H2>

<p>The Alias Input Variables category enables the user to specify the stochastic parameters that are to be randomly sampled and varied.&nbsp;&nbsp;A variable list is provided for the user with the description that is consistent with the descriptions given in the deterministic module’s input screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;This list of variables is derived from all possible stochastic parameters found in all deterministic modules connected to the S/U Module icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;The description provides the user with the variable name and the associated module name (both the module name given by the user and the FRAMES icon name are displayed). To sort the list of variables according to the module they belong to, choose the module name from below the main Alias Input Variables category on the collapsable menu on the left of the screen. The list can be further filtered into subcategories such as CAS ID, pathway and route by expanding each module list and selecting the desired subcategory.&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure below demonstrates a portion of the listing of stochastic parameters from a user defined module and a human health impacts module that have been connected to the S/U Module icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;To view the full list if it exceeds the length of the window, manually adjust the size of the window or use the scroll bar that will appear to the right of the list.

<p><IMG SRC="suvar.jpg">

<p><a name="VarAlias"></A><H3>Alias or surrogate name for model input parameter</H3>

<p>In order to reduce this list to just those parameters the user wishes to vary, the user is asked to provide a unique alias for each parameter of interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;A parameter of interest is one that is given a distribution, correlation, or used in an equation to describe another parameter of interest.

<p><a name="VarAdd"></A><H3>Adding an alias</H3>

<p>To add an alias, click on the white entry box to the right of the word "Alias."&nbsp;&nbsp;The alias should be one word (numbers or letters), is limited to eight (8) digits, and capitalization is preserved but is not used to distinguish between aliases.&nbsp;&nbsp;After typing the alias, click the Add button to enter the alias into the variable list.&nbsp;&nbsp;The variable description list will display the alias to the far left with a line ( | ) separating the alias from the description.&nbsp;&nbsp;This alias will be used to create a selection list for distributions, correlation, and equations.

<p><a name="VarDel"></A><H3>Deleting an alias</H3>

<p>To delete an alias the alias must first be removed from all parameter dependencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;The user must first delete any correlation and/or equation where the alias has been assigned.&nbsp;&nbsp;A Delete button is provided on the Alias Input Variables screen to remove the variable from the alias selection list.&nbsp;&nbsp;A warning will appear if any correlation or equation dependencies exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;By removing the alias from the variable list, the variable will no longer be available for distributions, correlation, or equations.&nbsp;&nbsp;This allows the user to reduce an alias listing to only those currently of interest.

<p><a name="VarChange"></A><H3>Changing an alias</H3>

<p>To change an alias, the user must first delete the old alias then add in the new alias.&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the instructions given for deleting an alias the user should remove the alias from all distributions and equations before selecting the alias to be deleted from the variables screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;A warning will appear if any correlation or equation dependencies exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;To add the new alias follow the guidance given for adding an alias.

<p><a name="VarView"></A><H3>View aliased inputs</H3>

<p>This function allows the user to shorten the list of available parameters to just those that have aliases associated with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is useful because when the list of parameters gets long, it can be difficult to track the parameters of interest (i.e., those that have been aliased.)


<p><a name="PARAM"></A><H2>Distributions/Correlations</H2>

<p>The Distributions/Correlations category enables the user to describe the variables of interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three options for describing the variables statistically.&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure below shows the Distributions/Correlations screen and the three tab options found within it: distribution, correlation, and equation.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several combinations of these options to aid the user in describing the variables of interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some combinations available to the user are:

<UL>
 <LI>giving the variable a statistical distribution only</LI>
 <LI>giving the variable a statistical distribution and correlating it to another variable of interest</LI>
 <LI>giving the variable a statistical distribution and using it in an equation to describe another variable</LI>
 <LI>using an equation to describe the variable</LI>
</UL>

<p><IMG SRC="su.jpg">

<p><a name="OUTSEED"></A><H3>Random Seed Value</H3>
Range: 1 to 999,999

<p>The seed value is an initial value that is required by the model to begin generating random sampling numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each different seed value will produce a unique sequence of random sampling numbers because the model uses each random number it produces to compute the next random number.&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of a seed value enables the modeler to reproduce sampled value results from previously performed analyses.&nbsp;&nbsp;The modeler simply needs to provide the same model inputs and seed value.

<p><a name="OUTITERATIONS"></A><H3>Number of iterations</H3>
Range: integer, lower bounded by the number of defined variable aliases and greater than 2

<p>The number of iterations is the number of sampling runs the user would like to make.&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted above, you must specify at least as many as iterations as defined variable aliases there are and can have as many iterations as allowed by the computer memory available for a single simulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a larger sample set is needed, the user can lower the seed value and perform more iterations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the two stochastic modeling runs can then be combined into a singe results set.&nbsp;&nbsp;This process can then be repeated as many times as deemed necessary by the user.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding to a results set in this way can help in an analysis because often with a larger results set, trends that exist are more pronounced.<br><br>

<p><a name="DELAY"></A><H3>Delay run unitl</H3>
Range: integer, 0 to 23

<p>The the time to start the S/U iterations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is entered in military time in hour increments only.<br><br>

<p><H4>This section provides guidance on using the distribution, correlation and equation features.</H4>

<p><a name="ALIAS"></A><H3>Parameter alias</H3>

<p>Alias for the parameter as defined on the Variables Tab.&nbsp;&nbsp;This alias will be used to specify stochastic parameters such as distribution, correlations, and equation relationships.

<p><a name="DIST"></A><H3>DISTRIBUTION TAB</H3>

<p>To assign a distribution to a variable the user must first have assigned the variable an alias (to learn how to assign an alias, review "Adding an alias" in the <A HREF="#VAR"> "Alias Input Variables"</A>section of this document).&nbsp;&nbsp;The distributions available in SUM<SUP>3</SUP> are: Uniform, Log Uniform, Normal, and Log Normal (Exponential, Triangular, Gamma, Beta, Weibull and Logistic distributions are not available in this version of SUM<SUP>3</SUP>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</A><A HREF="http://mepas.pnl.gov/FRAMESV1/images/fig4_2.gif"><b>Figure 4.2</b></A> gives an example shape for several of the distributions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each distribution will be discussed in this section.&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure below shows the dropdown menu of distribution types available in SUM<SUP>3</SUP>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The listing of available variable aliases, with their default units, is given in a selection listing on the mid-left side of the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;The variable description for the highlighted alias is provided in the grey box directly below the distribution tab.&nbsp;&nbsp;The user will be given the option to select preferred units for the distribution input parameters after a specific distribution is selected.&nbsp;&nbsp;SUM<SUP>3</SUP> will convert all units to the default units before initiating the simulation.

<p><IMG SRC="sudist1.jpg">

<p><a name="DISTTYPE"></A><H3>Distribution type for model input parameter</H3>

<p>In order to assign a distribution to an alias, the user must highlight the alias.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then click the arrow to the far left of the ‘Type’ box located on the distribution tab.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will bring down a selection list.&nbsp;&nbsp;The user can select the distribution type by highlighting and clicking on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;The user will be given the opportunity to enter the statistical input necessary for the selected distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the distribution parameters are entered they are preserved specifically for that alias and distribution type.&nbsp;&nbsp;Descriptions of the four currently available distribution types are given below:<br>

<p><b>Uniform</b>

<p>For the uniform distribution all values between the minimum value and maximum value are equally likely to be sampled.&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://mepas.pnl.gov/FRAMESV1/images/fig4_4.gif"><b>Figure 4.4</b></A> illustrates a uniform distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this example distribution the variable is the soil hydraulic conductivity from the second vadose zone.&nbsp;&nbsp;The variable is estimated to be somewhere between 100 cm/day and 700 cm/day.&nbsp;&nbsp;All values between 100 and 700 are equally likely to be selected for each simulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure below is a view of the input screen for a uniform distribution, where the upper bound and lower bound are entered in linear space.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clicking to the right of the units box will activate a selection listing of units.&nbsp;&nbsp;The user can select the units for the upper and lower bounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the user should be careful to adjust both upper and lower bounds to the appropriate units to ensure consistency.

<p><IMG SRC="sudist4.jpg"><br><br>

<p><b>Log Uniform</b>

<p>The Log Uniform distribution is like the Uniform Distribution in that all values between the lower bound and upper bound are equally as likely to be selected.&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional feature of the Log Uniform distribution is the ability to sample the data in Log space or E space.&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper bound and lower bound, however, are entered in the linear space.&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure below illustrates the input screen for the Log Uniform distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;This screen is similar to the uniform screen, with the addition of the Log Base selection option at the bottom of the tab screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;To choose the Base, click the arrow to the right of the Log Base box.&nbsp;&nbsp;A selection listing will be displayed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the Base for the distribution.

<p><IMG SRC="sudist3.jpg"><br><br>

<p><b>Normal</b>

<p>The Normal distribution is the most used distribution in probability theory because it describes many natural phenomena and is useful in describing uncertain variables.&nbsp;&nbsp;This distribution, shown in </A><A HREF="http://mepas.pnl.gov/FRAMESV1/images/fig4_7.gif"><b>Figure 4.7</b></A>, is often described as the bell curve.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several assumptions common to a normal distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, that there is a mean, (i.e., some value of the variable is the most likely).&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the value is symmetrical about the mean, and the uncertain variable could as likely be above the means as it could be below the mean.&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, the uncertain variable is more likely to be in the vicinity of the mean than far away (i.e., 68% of the values are within 1 standard deviation from the mean).&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://mepas.pnl.gov/FRAMESV1/images/fig4_7.gif"><b>Figure 4.7</b></A> illustrates a normal distribution for the thickness of the second vadose Zone.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this example the mean of the distribution is 213.36 cm with a lower bound of 200 cm and an upper bound of 225 cm.&nbsp;&nbsp;The standard deviation for this distribution is given as 5 cm.&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure below displays the input screen for the normal distribution, where the bounds, mean and standard deviation are entered.

<p><IMG SRC="sudist2.jpg"><br><br>

<p><b>Log Normal</b>

<p>The Log Normal distribution is widely used when most of the values occur near the minimum value, or are positively skewed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://mepas.pnl.gov/FRAMESV1/images/fig4_9.gif"><b>Figure 4.9</b></A> depicts a Log Normal distribution, in linear space, for the soil bulk density from vadose zone one.&nbsp;&nbsp;With a lower bound of 1 g/cm<SUP>3</SUP> and an upper bound of 2.65 g/cm<SUP>3</SUP>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The mean and standard deviation for the Log Normal distribution should be calculated in log space.&nbsp;&nbsp;For this example the mean is 0.215 gm/cm<SUP>3</SUP> and the standard deviation is 0.014 g/cm<SUP>3</SUP>.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some assumptions common to a normal distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;The variable cannot go below zero and the natural Logarithm of the variable is a normal distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure below displays the input screen for the Log Normal distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;The required parameters are upper bound, lower bound, mean, standard deviation, and Log Base.&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper and lower bounds are expected in the linear space.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mean and Standard Deviation are expected in the Log space.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two choices available for the Base: Base 10 and Base E.&nbsp;&nbsp;To choose the Base, click the arrow to the right of the Log Base box.&nbsp;&nbsp;A selection list will appear and the user can select the base for distribution from there.

<p><IMG SRC="sudist5.jpg"><br><br>

<p><a name="DISTUPPER"><H3>Upper bound for distribution</H3>
Units: selected by user<br>
Range: > Value entered by user for Lower Bound

<p>This is the upper bound of the distribution type selected.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sampled values will not exceed this value.<br>

<p><a name="DISTLOWER"></A><H3>Lower bound for distribution</H3>
Units: selected by user<br>
Range: < Value entered by user for Upper Bound

<p>This is the lower bound of the distribution type selected.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sampled values will be greater than this value.

<p><a name="DISTMEAN"></A><H3>Mean value for distribution</H3>
Units: selected by user

<p>This is the mean value for the distribution selected and is computed differently for the normal distribution and the log normal distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;The mean values are computed as follows:<br>

<OL>
 <LI> Normal Distribution: the mean of the sampled values<br>
 <br>Example: If the sample set is 1, 2, and 3.<br>
 The mean = (1+2+3)/3 = 2.<br><br>
 <LI> Log Normal Distribution: the mean of the logs of the sample values<br>
 <br>Example: If the sample set is 1, 2, and 3.<br>
 The mean = (log(1)+log(2)+log(3))/3 = 0.259384.<br>
 You would not simply take the log of the mean (i.e., log(2) = 0.30103).
</OL>

<p><a name="DISTSTD"></A><H3>Standard deviation for distribution</H3>
Units: selected by user<br>
Range: Lower bound for distribution < and > Upper bound for distribution

<p>This is the standard deviation for the distribution selected and is computed differently for the normal distribution and the log normal distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;The standard deviations are computed as follows:<br>

<OL>
 <LI> Normal Distribution: the standard deviation of the sampled values<br>
 <br>Example: If the sample set is 1, 2, and 3.<br>
 The standard deviation = 1<br><br>
 <LI> Log Normal Distribution: the standard deviation of the logs of the sample values<br>
 <br>Example: If the sample set is 1, 2, and 3.<br>
 The standard deviation = 0.241272<br>
 You would not simply take the log of the standard deviation (i.e., log(1) = 0).
</OL>

<p><a name="DISTBASE"></A><H3>Base value for log distributions</H3>

<p>This parameter is the base unit for log distributions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two choices are available: 10 and e.<br><br>

<p><a name="COR"></A><H3>CORRELATION TAB</H3>

<p>To assign a correlation to a set of variables the user must first have assigned the variables aliases (to learn how to assign an alias, review "Adding an alias" in the <A HREF="#VAR"> "Alias Input Variables"</A>section of this document).

<p><a name="CORALIAS"></A><H3>Alias or surrogate name for model input parameter</H3>

<p>Alias for the parameter as defined on the Alias Input Variables screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;The aliases are used to specify parameter correlations.

<p><a name="CORCOR"></A><H3>Correlating parameters</H3>
Range: -1 < and > 1

<p>A correlation option is used to account for dependencies (correlations) between two parameters.&nbsp;&nbsp;The correlation of two variables allows the user to ensure the preservation of a relationship between the variables.&nbsp;&nbsp;The correlation parameter is a ratio of one variable to the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the correlation parameter can range from –1 to +1.&nbsp;&nbsp;A correlation of –1 represents a strong negative correlation, meaning one variable increases while the second variable decreases.&nbsp;&nbsp;A correlation of +1 represents a strong positive correlation, meaning one variable increases while the second variable increases.&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise a correlation of 0 implies no correlation between the variables.&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure below displays the input screen for variable correlation.

<p><IMG SRC="sucor.jpg">

<p><a name="CORADD"></A><H3>Adding a correlation between parameters</H3>

<p>To add a correlation between two parameters, follow these steps:<br><br>

<OL>
 <LI>Select an alias of the first parameter in the list on the mid-left.
 <LI>On the Correlations tab, select the alias of the second parameter in the dropdown box.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the parameter you are interested in is not in the list, that means that you have not added an alias for it yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will need to go back to "Alias Input Variables" and add it first.
 <LI>Type in a correlation in the correlations box.&nbsp;&nbsp;The number must be between -1 and +1.
 <LI>Hit the Add button.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your correlation should appear in the window on the left of the tab.&nbsp;&nbsp;The parameter that is highlighted in the list on the mid-left is correlated to the parameter in the window by the number indicated.
</OL>

<p><a name="CORDEL"></A><H3>Deleting a correlation between parameters</H3>

<p>This option allows you to delete a correlation that has been entered.&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this, follow these steps:<br>

<OL>
 <LI>Select an alias of the first parameter in the list on the mid-left.
 <LI>On the Correlations tab, select the alias of the second parameter from the window in the middle of the tab.
 <LI>Hit the Delete button.&nbsp;&nbsp;The correlation should disappear from the window in the middle of the tab.
</OL>

<a name="CORCURRENT"></A><H3>Correlations</H3>

<p>This window displays the correlations that have been entered.&nbsp;&nbsp;Click on the parameter aliases from the list on the mid-left of the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are correlations for the parameter, they will appear in the correlations window.<br><br>

<p><a name="EQU"></A><H3>EQUATION TAB</H3>

The equation feature enables a user to relate two or more variables as a function of those variables.&nbsp;&nbsp;All independent variables will be sampled, then the dependent variable will be calculated.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Total Porosity can be computed as a function of Bulk Density.&nbsp;&nbsp;To preserve this relationship throughout the simulation, the equation can be entered.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the simulation Bulk density will be sampled, then Total Porosity will be calculated using the given equation<br>

<p>Total Porosity= 1-(Bulk Density/2.65)

<p><a name="EQUEQUATION"></A><H3>Equations to specify relationships between parameters</H3>

<p>To assign an equation to a variable, the user must first have assigned the variable, and all variables used in the equation, an alias (to learn how to assign an alias, review "Adding an alias" in the <A HREF="#VAR"> "Alias Input Variables"</A>section of this document).Only the right side of the equation need be entered.&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure below demonstrates the equation option.

<p><IMG SRC="suequ.jpg">

<p><a name="EQUADD"></A><H3>Adding an equation</H3>

<p>To add an equation, first resolve the equation by solving for one variable in terms of the others.&nbsp;&nbsp;Highlight the dependent variable to be represented by the equation from the alias listing on the mid-left of the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then enter the equation, the right side only, in the box labeled "Enter an equation."&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure that the equation has been resolved to match the units displayed next to the dependent alias.&nbsp;&nbsp;The equation can contain most arithmetic operators (e.g.&nbsp; - + / * exp ).&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Add button.

<p>To edit an equation, highlight the dependent variable represented by the equation from the alias listing on the mid-left of the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then edit the equation in the box labeled "Enter an equation."&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the current equation will be displayed in the "Current Equation" box.&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure that the equation has been resolved to match the units displayed next to the dependent alias.&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Add button.

<p><a name="EQUDEL"></A><H3>Deleting an equation</H3>

<p>To delete an equation, highlight the dependent variable represented by the equation from the alias listing on the mid-left of the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Confirm the equation to be deleted in the "Current Equation" box.&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Delete button.

<p><a name="OUT"></A><H2>Alias Output Watches</H2>

<p>The Alias Output Watches category enables the user to specify the results to be preserved from the simulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;An output list is provided for the user identifying which module each output comes from as well as describing what the results are.&nbsp;&nbsp;This list of outputs is derived from all possible results produced from all media connected to the S/U icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;To sort the list of variables according to the module they belong to, choose the module name from below the main Alias Output Watches category on the collapsable menu on the far left of the screen.  The list can be further filtered into subcategories such as CAS ID, pathway and route by expanding each module list and selecting the desired subcategory.  The figure below demonstrates a portion of the listing of outputs from an user defined module and a human health impacts module that have been connected to the S/U Module icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;To view the full list if it exceeds the length of the window, manually adjust the size of the window or use the scroll bar that will appear to the right of the list.

<p><IMG SRC="suout.jpg">

<p><a name="OUTALIAS"></A><H3>Output parameter alias</H3>

<p>The user is asked to provide a unique alias for each output of interest.

<p><a name="OUTADD"></A><H3>Adding an ouput parameter alias</H3>

<p>To add an alias, click on the white entry box to the right of the word "Alias".&nbsp;&nbsp;The alias should be one word (letters and numbers), is limited to eight (8) digits, and capitalization is preserved but is not used to distinguish between aliases.&nbsp;&nbsp;After typing the alias, click the Add button to enter the alias into the variable list.&nbsp;&nbsp;The output list will display the alias to the far left with a line ( | ) separating the alias from the description.<br>

There are three types of output results that can be captured for each output parameter and they are as follows:
<OL>
 <LI>Peak - The peak value in the time varying output.
 <LI>Average Years # to # - The average value over a user-specified time range.
 <LI>At Year(s) #(,#...) - The value at a user-specified time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to five times can be specified.
</OL>

<p>Here is an example scenario to help illustrate the three choices.&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose the user is interested in the constituent concentration results at a well location, which are being ouput by an aquifer/groundwater model.&nbsp;&nbsp;The model outputs time-varying constituent concentrations at the well location of interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following describes outcomes associated with each output option:
<OL>
 <LI>Peak - SUM<SUP>3</SUP> will report out the peak constituent concentration and its associated time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The selection option will be presented in this format: <I>Aquifer(module ID) water concentration peak for (constituent name)</I>
 <LI>Average Years # to # - SUM<SUP>3</SUP> will report out the average constituent concentration over a specified time frame.&nbsp;&nbsp;The user will be prompted to enter a beginning and ending time.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example from year 50 to year 100.<br>The selection option will be presented in this format: <I>Aquifer(module ID) water concentration average years # to # for (constituent name)</I>
 <LI>At Year(s) #(,#...) - SUM<SUP>3</SUP> will report out the constituent concentration at specified times (up to 5).&nbsp;&nbsp;The user will be prompted to enter the time(s) of interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;This would be used if the user needed to know specifically what the concentration is at a certain year (or years).<br>The selection option will be presented in this format: <I>Aquifer(module ID) water concentration at year(s) #(,#...) for (constituent name)</I>
</OL>

<p>Where (module ID) is the module identification number associated with the module's icon in the FRAMES workspace window.

<p><a name="OUTCHANGE"></A><H3>Changing an output parameter alias</H3>

<p>First select the output to be changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing alias will appear in grey text in the alias box.&nbsp;&nbsp;Click delete and then repeat the process of adding a new alias.&nbsp;&nbsp;The variable list will be updated with the new alias.

<p><a name="OUTDEL"></A><H3>Deleting an ouptput parameter alias</H3>

<p>A Delete button is provided to eliminate outputs from the alias list for distributions.&nbsp;&nbsp;By removing the alias from the output list, the output will no longer be preserved.&nbsp;&nbsp;This allows the user to reduce an alias listing to those currently of interest.

<p><a name="OUTTIME"></A><H3>Time to monitor</H3>

<p>This field allows the user to specify: 1) the time, or times, that results are reported when the 'At Year(s)' option is selected

<p><IMG SRC="suoutavyears.jpg">

<p>&nbsp;or 2) the time range when the 'Average Years' option is selected.

<p><IMG SRC="suoutmonitor.jpg">

<p>When the 'Peak' option is selected, the user does not specify a time because the SUM<SUP>3</SUP> will select the time associated with the peak output value.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if a user was modeling constituent concentrations at a well location, he/she may want to know the constituent concentration specifically at year 120.&nbsp;&nbsp;The user could monitor this result using this option.

<p><a name="OUTVIEW"></A><H3>View aliased outputs</H3>

<p>This function allows the user to shorten the list of output parameters to just those that have aliases associated with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is useful because when the list of output parameters becomes long, it can be difficult to track the parameters of interest (i.e., those that have been aliased.)
