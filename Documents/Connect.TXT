The connection section of the description file 
designates which files are read by the model and 
which file types are written by the model. Users
make file selections by selecting the appropriate
checkboxes within the displayed file list. If the 
files are selected from the Read list the user must
also enter values for the minimum and maximum number
of files for that filetype that can be read by the 
model. The description file editor does not perform 
any error checking for the combinations of read 
and writes that a model may perform so it is up to 
the user to ensure that correct files are selected 
for inclusion into the description file. 

The following is an example of the connection 
section of a description file.
