<b><font size=+1>GENII NESHAPS Report Generator User Interface</font></b>
<p><b>Method Selections</b>
<p>Three options are available.&nbsp; Check the appropriate box
<p><b>Include Atmospheric Dispersion and Deposition Estimates</b>:&nbsp;
This output provides the minimum required for reporting doses and risks
to the Maximally Exposed Individual.&nbsp; This option will report the
Name and Address of the facility being modeled along with the&nbsp; doses
and/or risks to individuals.
<p>Selection of this option activates a "Site/User Identification" tab.&nbsp;
Several areas are provided for the input of identifying text information.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This information is repeated verbatim in the output.
<p><b>Include Population Dose/Risk Estimates</b>:&nbsp; This option allows
calculation of doses and/or risks of the population within the boundaries
of the calculation grid.&nbsp; The Population input file structure must
match that of the calculation grid - e.g., the number of radial directions
and distances must be those used in the atmospheric dispersion module.&nbsp;
The current version of the module does not have a "Browse" feature, so
the exact filename (and path, if the file is not stored in the FRAMES directory)
must be entered.
<p>Selection of this option also activates the "Site/User Identification"
tab.&nbsp; Several areas are provided for the input of identifying text
information.&nbsp;&nbsp; This information is repeated verbatim in the output.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Provide only Individual Dose/Risk Output:&nbsp;</b> This option allows
printing of a short summary of the individual output without any identifying
information attached.&nbsp; No additional method or parameter information
is required.
