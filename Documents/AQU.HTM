<a name="WZCLASS"></a><u><b>WZ-CLASS</b>--Subsurface soil textural classification</u>
<br />Units: none
<br />
<br />The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) soil textural
classification scheme is used by the MEPAS modules. This scheme is
based on the relative proportions of sand, silt and clay by weight normalized
to 100 percent. Refer to site documents to determine an appropriate
soil textural classification.
<br />
<br />Selecting a soil texture results in the assignment of
default values for percent sand (<a href="#WZSAND">WZ-SAND</a>), percent
silt (<a href="#WZSILT">WZ-SILT</a>), percent clay (<a href="#WZCLAY">WZ-CLAY</a>),
percent organic matter (<a href="#WZOMC">WZ-OMC</a>), and percent iron
and aluminum (<a href="#WZIRON">WZ-IRON</a>). If "Autofill" is enabled
(i.e., checked) under the "Options" menu, default values are also assigned
for total porosity (<a href="#WZTOTPOR">WZ-TOTPOR</a>) and dry bulk density
(<a href="#WZBULKD">WZ-BULKD</a>). The default values are the same
as those listed in <a href="TAB_2_1.HTM">Table 2.1</a>. These assignments
are not necessarily permanent - they can be changed to site specific values
at any time.
<br />
<br /><a name="WZSAND"></a><u><b>WZ-SAND</b>--Percent sand of saturated zone soil</u>
<br />Units: percent (%)
<br />Range: 0 to 100
<br />
<br />If the percentage of sand is not available from site
documents, a typical value can be selected from <a href="TAB_2_1.HTM">Table
2.1</a> for the soil textural classification determined in Section <a href="#WZCLASS">WZ-CLASS</a>
above. The percentage of sand is only used
for the estimation of subsurface adsorption coefficients (<a href="#WASUBKD">WA-SUBKD</a>)
for organic constituents. The sum of
percent sand (<a href="#WZSAND">WZ-SAND</a>), percent silt (<a href="#WZSILT">WZ-SILT</a>),
percent clay (<a href="#WZCLAY">WZ-CLAY</a>), percent organic matter (<a href="#WZOMC">WZ-OMC</a>),
and percent iron and aluminum (<a href="#WZIRON">WZ-IRON</a>) must be 100.
<br />
<br /><a name="WZSILT"></a><u><b>WZ-SILT</b>--Percent silt of saturated zone soil</u>
<br />Units: percent (%)
<br />Range: 0 to 100
<br />
<br />If the percentage of silt is not available from site
documents, a typical value can be selected from <a href="TAB_2_1.HTM">Table
2.1</a> for the soil textural classification determined in Section <a href="#WZCLASS">WZ-CLASS</a>
above. The percentage of silt is only used
for the estimation of subsurface adsorption coefficients (<a href="#WASUBKD">WA-SUBKD</a>)
for organic constituents. The sum of
percent sand (<a href="#WZSAND">WZ-SAND</a>), percent silt (<a href="#WZSILT">WZ-SILT</a>),
percent clay (<a href="#WZCLAY">WZ-CLAY</a>), percent organic matter (<a href="#WZOMC">WZ-OMC</a>),
and percent iron and aluminum (<a href="#WZIRON">WZ-IRON</a>) must be 100.
<br />
<br /><a name="WZCLAY"></a><u><b>WZ-CLAY</b>--Percent clay of saturated zone soil</u>
<br />Units: percent (%)
<br />Range: 0 to 100
<br />
<br />If the percentage of clay is not available from site
documents, a typical value can be selected from <a href="TAB_2_1.HTM">Table
2.1</a> for the soil textural classification determined in Section <a href="#WZCLASS">WZ-CLASS</a>
above. The percentage of clay is only used
for the estimation of subsurface adsorption coefficients (<a href="#WASUBKD">WA-SUBKD</a>)
for both organic and inorganic constituents.
The sum of percent sand (<a href="#WZSAND">WZ-SAND</a>), percent silt (<a href="#WZSILT">WZ-SILT</a>),
percent clay (<a href="#WZCLAY">WZ-CLAY</a>), percent organic matter (<a href="#WZOMC">WZ-OMC</a>),
and percent iron and aluminum (<a href="#WZIRON">WZ-IRON</a>) must be 100.
<br />
<br /><a name="WZOMC"></a><u><b>WZ-OMC</b>--Percent organic matter content of saturated zone soil</u>
<br />Units: percent (%)
<br />Range: 0.00 to 9.99
<br />
<br />Obtain the percentage of organic matter from site documents,
if possible. Often times, the fraction of organic carbon (f<sub>oc</sub>)
will be available. Since the carbon content of organic matter in
environmental systems is generally about 58 percent, the percentage of
organic matter can be estimated from the fraction of organic carbon as
follows:
<br />
<br />
<center>Organic Matter (%) = 1.7 x
(Fraction Organic Carbon) x 100 (%)</center>
<br />If the percentage of organic matter is not available
from site documents and cannot otherwise be determined, assume it is zero.
<br />
<br />The percentage of organic matter
is only used for the estimation of subsurface adsorption coefficients
(<a href="#WASUBKD">WA-SUBKD</a>) for organic constituents.
The sum of percent sand (<a href="#WZSAND">WZ-SAND</a>), percent silt (<a href="#WZSILT">WZ-SILT</a>),
percent clay (<a href="#WZCLAY">WZ-CLAY</a>), percent organic matter (<a href="#WZOMC">WZ-OMC</a>),
and percent iron and aluminum (<a href="#WZIRON">WZ-IRON</a>) must be 100.
<br />
<br /><a name="WZIRON"></a><u><b>WZ-IRON</b>--Percent iron and aluminum in saturated zone soil</u>
<br />Units: percent (%)
<br />Range: 0 to 99
<br />Typical environmental range: 0 to 10
<br />
<br />If the percentage of iron and aluminum is not available
from site documents, assume it is zero. The
percentage of iron and aluminum is only used for the estimation of subsurface
adsorption coefficients (<a href="#WASUBKD">WA-SUBKD</a>) for
inorganic constituents. The sum of percent sand (<a href="#WZSAND">WZ-SAND</a>),
percent silt (<a href="#WZSILT">WZ-SILT</a>), percent clay (<a href="#WZCLAY">WZ-CLAY</a>),
percent organic matter (<a href="#WZOMC">WZ-OMC</a>), and percent iron
and aluminum (<a href="#WZIRON">WZ-IRON</a>) must be 100.

<br />
<br />
<a name="CHARACTERISTICS"></a>
<h2>CHARACTERISTICS TAB</h2>

<a name="WZFRACT"></a><u><b>WZ-FRACT</b>--Percent of total flux to aquifer</u>
<br />Units: percent (%)
<br />Range: greater than 0.01 and less or equal to 100.
<br />
<br />This option allows the consideration of multiple aquifers
by allowing a partial mass flux of constituent to different aquifers.
Enter the percent of the total constituent flux that is expected to move
into the subject aquifer. Almost always, WZ-FRACT is set to 100.
<br />
<br /><a name="WZPH"></a><u><b>WZ-PH</b>--pH of the pore water in the saturated zone</u>
<br />Units: none
<br />Range: 0.1 to 14.0
<br />
<br />If pH is unavailable from site documents, use pH = 7
(i.e., neutral conditions) . The
pH is only used for the estimation of subsurface adsorption coefficients
(<a href="#WASUBKD">WA-SUBKD</a>) for inorganic constituents.
<br />
<br /><a name="WZTOTPOR"></a><u><b>WZ-TOTPOR</b>--Total porosity of the saturated zone</u>
<br />Units: percent (%)
<br />Range: 0.1 to 99.9
<br />
<br />If total porosity is not available for the saturated
zone, use the values from <a href="TAB_2_1.HTM">Table 2.1</a> for the appropriate
soil-textural classification determined in Section <a href="#WZCLASS">WZ-CLASS</a>.
If you must choose between two categories, choose an average value.
This value should correlate to the dry bulk density identified in Section
<a href="#WZBULKD">WZ-BULKD</a> as follows:
<br />
<br />
<center>Porosity = 1 - (Dry Bulk Density/Specific Weight)</center>
<br />If the specific weight is unknown, it can be approximated
as 2.65 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.
<br />
<br /><a name="WZEFFPOR"></a><u><b>WZ-EFFPOR</b>--Effective porosity of saturated zone</u>
<br />Units: percent (%)
<br />Range: 0.1 to WZ-TOTPOR
<br />
<br />The effective porosity is the pore space that contributes
to advective flow. If effective porosity is not available for the
saturated zone, interpolate using the following: sand = 25%, silt = 15%,
and clay = 10%. The value used must be less than or equal to the
value for total porosity given in Section <a href="AQU.HTM#WZTOTPOR">WZ-TOTPOR
</a>and <a href="TAB_2_1.HTM">Table 2.1</a>. Be sure the value chosen
is consistent with the value used in Section <a href="AQU.HTM#WZPVELOC">WZ-PVELOC
</a>(Darcy velocity in the saturated zone).
<br />
<br /><a name="WZPVELOC"></a><u><b>WZ-PVELOC</b>--Darcy velocity in the saturated zone</u>
<br />Units: feet per day (ft/day)
<br />Range: greater than 0.0
<br />
<br />The parameter WZ-PVELOC represents Darcy or bulk velocity
of ground water flow (i.e., the velocity that would result for an effective
porosity of 100 %). If no value is available from the site data,
Darcy velocity (Vd) can be estimated by:
<br />
<br />
<center>Vd = K (H<sub>1</sub> - H<sub>2</sub>)/d</center>
<br />where K is the saturated hydraulic conductivity (ft/day),
and (H<sub>1</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>)/d is hydraulic gradient, defined as the
difference in hydraulic head at two points in the aquifer, divided by the
distance (d) between the two points. This information can be obtained
from water table or potentiometric surface maps.
<br />If no value is available for saturated hydraulic conductivity,
a typical value can be selected from <a href="TAB_2_1.HTM">Table 2.1</a>
for the soil textural classification determined in Section <a href="#WZCLASS">WZ-CLASS</a>.
<br />
<br />In contrast with Darcy velocity, the pore water velocity
(Vp) can be estimated as Darcy velocity divided by effective porosity (see
Section <a href="#WZEFFPOR">WZ-EFFPOR</a>):
<br />
<br />
<center>Vp = Vd/ne</center>
<br />where ne is the effective porosity expressed as a fraction.
The constituent velocity (Vc) can be estimated by:
<br />
<br />
<center>Vc = Vp/R<sub>f</sub></center>
<br />where R<sub>f</sub> is the retardation factor and is
defined as:
<br />
<br />
<center>Rf = 1 + K<sub>d</sub> (Bd/ne)</center>
<br />where Bd and K<sub>d</sub> are dry bulk density (see
Section <a href="AQU.HTM#WZBULKD">WZ-BULKD</a>) and the equilibrium (partition
or distribution) coefficient (see Section <a href="#WASUBKD">WA-SUBKD</a>),
respectively.
<br />
<br />If sampling indicates that constituents have moved from
the release site, check to ensure that the calculated constituent velocity
(Vc) is consistent with the speed at which the constituent plume is traveling
in the aquifer. The constituent cannot be moving faster than the water
(except by longitudinal dispersion) but it can move significantly slower,
depending on its retardation (equilibrium coefficient, Section <a href="#WASUBKD">WA-SUBKD</a>).
If the calculated constituent velocity (Vc) is different from the apparent
speed of the constituent plume (due to retardation), adjust the Kd value,
then Darcy velocity, so the calculated constituent velocity is equal to
the speed of the plume.
<br />
<br /><a name="WZTHICK"></a><u><b>WZ-THICK</b>--Thickness of saturated zone</u>
<br />Units: feet (ft)
<br />Range: 0.1 to 9999.9
<br />
<br />The parameter WZ-THICK is the aquifer thickness, which
is defined as the distance from the water table to the bottom of (the vertical
extent of) the aquifer. The saturated thickness should be obtained
from the site data.
<br />
<br /><a href="FIG_2_21.HTM">Figure 2.21</a> illustrates a
cross section of a release site. In this example, the saturated thickness,
WZ-THICK, would be 60 feet.
<br />
<br /><a name="WZBULKD"></a><u><b>WZ-BULKD</b>--Dry bulk density of saturated zone</u>
<br />Units: grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm<sup>3</sup>)
<br />Range: 1.00 to 3.00
<br />Typical environmental range: see <a href="TAB_2_1.HTM">Table 2.1</a>
<br />
<br />If the dry bulk density is not available for the saturated
zone, use the value from <a href="TAB_2_1.HTM">Table 2.1</a> for the appropriate
soil textural classification determined in Section <a href="#WZCLASS">WZ-CLASS</a>
above. To be conservative, choose the <u>smallest</u> value of bulk
density when trying to decide between two categories. This value
should correspond to the total porosity identified in Section <a href="AQU.HTM#WZTOTPOR">WZ-TOTPOR</a>.

<br />
<br />
<a name="LOCATIONS"></a>
<h2>CONCENTRATION LOCATIONS AND FLUX LOCATIONS TAB</h2>

<a name="WZDIST"></a><u><b>WZ-DIST</b>--Travel distance in saturated zone</u>
<br />Units: feet (ft)
<br />Range: greater than 0.0
<br />
<br />WZ-DIST must be determined for each downgradient receptor.
This distance is measured from the <u>center</u> of the release site to
each downgradient point such as a well or a river into which the groundwater
discharges. This distance can be determined from the site documents
and maps or from 7.5-min USGS topographic maps. Carefully determine
the downgradient direction. It will correspond to the direction used
to determine the hydraulic head in Section <a href="AQU.HTM#WZPVELOC">WZ-PVELOC</a>.
<br />
<br /><a href="FIG_2_22.HTM">Figure 2.22</a> illustrates an
example waste site with two distances "a" and "b" from the release site
to the river. In this example, the distance "b" should be used because
constituents must flow along the groundwater flow path (from the waste
site to Point B). Also consult <a href="FIG_2_23.HTM">Figure 2.23</a>
which illustrates a relationship between WZ-DIST and <a href="AQU.HTM#WZYDIST">WZ-YDIST</a>.
It should be noted that WZ-DIST is not necessarily the distance between
the center of source to receptor. If the receptor well is some way
off the downgradient flow direction as illustrated in Figure 2.23, WZ-DIST
can be determined as follows: first, draw a line through the plume
centerline or a line of downgradient flow path through the center of the
source area. Second, draw a second line from the receptor well, perpendicular
to the plume centerline or line of flow path (i.e., the first line).
Then, measure the distance between the crossed point and the center of
waste unit, which is WZ-DIST.
<br />
<br />The aquifer module is not designed to handle the case
where a receptor well occurs within the boundaries of the waste site (i.e.,
within the actual area where constituent is released). Therefore,
all receptor wells should be located no closer to the center of the source
than the downgradient edge of the source (i.e., the distance to the receptor
should never be less than half the length of the waste site).
<br />
<br /><a name="WZYDIST"></a><u><b>WZ-YDIST</b>--Perpendicular distance from groundwater flow centerline to receptor</u>
<br />Units: feet (ft)
<br />Range: greater than or equal to 0.0
<br />
<br />This option allows the consideration of transverse variation
of groundwater plume concentrations. For evaluation of plume centerline
concentrations, enter a value of 0.0 (most conservative). For evaluation
of off-centerline plume concentrations, enter the perpendicular distance
from plume centerline to the receptor well, as illustrated in <a href="FIG_2_23.HTM">Figure
2.23</a>. The plume is assumed to be symmetric, and this parameter
is defined as being positive on either side of plume centerline.
<br />
<br /><a name="WZAQDEPTH"></a><u><b>WZ-AQDEPTH</b>--Vertical distance below groundwater table</u>
<br />Units: feet (ft)
<br />Range: greater than or equal to 0.0
<br />
<br />WZ-AQDEPTH is the depth or vertical distance measured
from the surface of the ground water table to the point where constituent
concentration is to be computed. <a href="FIG_2_24.HTM">Figure 2.24</a>
illustrates examples of WZ-AQDEPTH. Note that the concentration is
computed as if the well does not exist; i.e., radial dilution by uncontaminated
water is not taken into account. Entering WZ-AQDEPTH = 0 provides
the most conservative result.
<br />
<br /><a name="WZLDISP"></a><u><b>WZ-LDISP</b>--Longitudinal dispersivity</u>
<br />Units: feet (ft)
<br />Range: greater than 0.0
<br />
<br />Enter the longitudinal (or x-direction) dispersivity
for the saturated zone from site documents, or use the "Estimate" button
if a value is not available. The following equation is used for the estimate:
<br />
<br />
<center>WZ-LDISP = 0.1 (WZ-DIST)</center>
<br />where <a href="#WZDIST">WZ-DIST</a> is the longitudinal travel distance.
<br />
<br /><a name="WZTDISP"></a><u><b>WZ-TDISP</b>--Transverse dispersivity</u>
<br />Units: feet (ft)
<br />Range: greater than 0.0
<br />
<br />Enter the transverse (or y-direction) dispersivity for
the saturated zone from site documents, or use the "Estimate" button if
a value is not available. The following equation is used for the estimate:
<br />
<br />
<center>WZ-TDISP = 0.33 (WZ-LDISP)</center>
<br />where <a href="#WZDIST">WZ-LDISP</a> is the longitudinal dispersivity.
<br />
<br /><a name="WZVDISP"></a><u><b>WZ-VDISP</b>--Vertical dispersivity</u>
<br />Units: feet (ft)
<br />Range: greater than 0.0
<br />
<br />Enter the vertical (or z-direction) dispersivity for
the saturated zone from site documents, or use the "Estimate" button if
a value is not available. The following equation is used for the estimate:
<br />
<br />
<center>WZ-VDISP = 0.0025 (WZ-LDISP)</center>
<br />where <a href="#WZDIST">WZ-LDISP</a> is the longitudinal dispersivity.

<h2>CONSTITUENT PROPERTIES TAB</h2>

<a name="FSCNAME"></a><u><b>FS-CNAME</b>--Name of constituent(s) for current transport scenario</u>
<br />
<br />This field shows the constituents that are selected for
the scenario. Use the arrow buttons to scroll through the list of
constituents and enter an adsorption coefficient and water solubility for
each one, and a degradation/decay half-life for non-radionuclides.
If a constituent has decay products, they will be shown on the bottom part
of this screen.
<br />
<br /><a name="WASUBKD"></a><u><b>WA-SUBKD</b>--Subsurface adsorption coefficients</u>
<br />Units: milliliters per gram (ml/g)
<br />Range: greater than or equal to 0.0
<br />
<br />WA-SURFKD represents the equilibrium (partition or distribution)
coefficient (K<sub>d</sub>) of constituent between the soil particles and
the soil water. Use laboratory or field-derived K<sub>d</sub> values
if they are available from site documents or reports of studies using similar
soil and constituent characteristics. Theoretically, K<sub>d</sub> is defined as:
<br />
<br />
<center>K<sub>d</sub> = C<sub>p</sub>/C<sub>d</sub></center>
<br />
where C<sub>p</sub> is the particulate concentration
(i.e., weight or activity of adsorbed constituent per weight of solid)
and C<sub>d</sub> is the dissolved concentration or activity. Although
the K<sub>d</sub> value of a constituent of concern can be determined in
the laboratory or obtained from published literature, such values can vary
considerably depending upon the experimental or environmental conditions
(e.g., characteristics of soil and water) and technique used. When
choosing between K<sub>d</sub> values, use the value which will provide
the conservative results (e.g., highest risk). For example, a low
K<sub>d</sub> value would pose a high risk to an offsite receptor who ingests
ground water because the constituent would be readily dissolved into water
and mobilized. Note that because of the uncertainty associated with
K<sub>d</sub>, it is preferably used as a calibration parameter to adjust
the constituent velocity.
<br />
<br /><b>Selecting Adsoption Coefficient</b> - The aquifer module can provide estimates of K<sub>d</sub>
for all constituents. For inorganic constituents, typical K<sub>d</sub>
values reported in the peer reviewed literature are provided by the user
interface, via a lookup table, based on the soil water pH (<a href="#WZPH">WZ-PH</a>), percent
clay (<a href="#WZCLAY">WZ-CLAY</a>) and percent iron and aluminum (<a href="#WZIRON">WP-IRON</a>).
For organic constituents, the percent sand (<a href="#WZSAND">WZ-SAND</a>),
percent silt (<a href="#WZSILT">WZ-SILT</a>), percent clay (<a href="#WZCLAY">WZ-CLAY</a>),
and percent organic matter (<a href="#WZOMC">WZ-OMC</a>) are used in an
empirical equation to provide a K<sub>d</sub> estimate.
<br />The dropdown box gives the user the choice to select a K<sub>d</sub> from

</ol>
<br /><a name="WZSOL"></a><u><b>WZ-SOL</b>--Water solubility</u>
<br />Units: milligrams per liter (mg/l) or picocuries per milliliter (pCi/ml)
<br />Range: greater than or equal to 0.0
<br />
<br />Enter the aqueous solubility for the constituent.
For most organic constituents, this value is available in the constituent
database or in chemical property books. For inorganic constituents,
this value will have to be estimated based on the geochemistry of the waste
zone. If a value is available in the constituent database, it will
be used as an initial default value. If a database value is not available,
the solubility is set to 0, which is used as an indicator meaning an unknown
solubility. The aquifer module only uses the water solubility for
a comparison with the concentration of constituent entering the aquifer
and the concentration computed at the receptor locations. If a concentration
exceeds the solubility, a warning message is written to a warning message
file (<I>casename</I>.WRN) and to the Waterborne Listing File (<I>casename</I>.WLS)
for receptor concentrations. If the solubility is 0, this comparision
is not performed.
<br />
<br /><a name="WZGHALF"></a><u><b>WZ-GHALF</b>--Half-life in ground water</u>
<br />Units: years
<br />Range: greater than 0.0
<br />
<br />This parameter is the half-life of the constituent
in the aquifer. For radionuclide and non-radionuclide constituents, this value defaults to
the data in the constituent database, but the value can be changed to a site-specific value.
This parameter can be used to implement other degradation rates (e.g., biodegradation, photo
degradation, etc...) when they are converted to equivalent half-lives.
