The purpose of FRAMES is to assist users in developing environmental scenarios and to provide options for selecting the most appropriate computer codes to conduct human and environmental risk management analyses. 

FRAMES accomplishes this purpose by:

Allowing users to link codes under one integrated system using standard data file specifications
Building a conceptual site model (CSM) using module icons in a WindowsTM-based interface in order to represent flow of contamination through environment
Conducting sensitivity and uncertainty analyses on assessments
Viewing analyses results using graphical and text viewers
FRAMES exhibits four unique attributes that are unparalleled by any other environmental operations and assessment modeling tools produced today.

# User Friendly
FRAMES provides the capability to conceptualize environmental issues using an intuitive drag-and-drop system of icons to construct a pictorial display. FRAMES also employs user-friendly interfaces for easy data entry and model selection. All of FRAMES user interfaces have on-line help associated with them to provide users with information at their fingertips.

# Flexibility
FRAMES is designed to allow independently developed codes to be fully integrated. FRAMES can accommodate codes written in different programming languages. Once a code is fully integrated into FRAMES, it functions with other integrated codes and the FRAMES sensitivity uncertainty module. With FRAMES, users can develop a personalized modeling system with preferred and/or required codes.

# Comprehensive
FRAMES allows users to model constituent movement from its original source, through the environment, and to the environmental or human receptors. Then it provides their associated health impacts. This type of holistic approach is critical to assessing highly interactive and interrelated issues associated with Environmental, Safety, and Health risks. 

FRAMES also allows users to view modeling information through text, table, and graphical views to confirm and verify information. In addition, FRAMES provides a method of determining which modeling parameters impact results the most and levels of uncertainty involved in results based on these parameters. This analysis gives managers a critical piece of information missing in many such assessments â€” what can be changed to lessen the environmental impacts. FRAMES is a fully documented software platform and has been co-funded by DOE, EPA, DOD, and Battelle.

# Application-Oriented
This software platform was developed with problem-solving in mind and is application-orientated. FRAMES combines the best of both government and industrial technical knowledge and expertise, and it has been independently reviewed for technicality and usability.
