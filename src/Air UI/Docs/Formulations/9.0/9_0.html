In addition to the evaluation of potential longer-term chronic impacts,
many situations require consideration of potential acute impacts over a
shorter time period. The processes are the same as discussed for the long-term
impacts; the released material is transported and dispersed by air movement.
The difference is the concern for a release occurring over a relatively
short time—resulting in a greater range of possible plume concentrations
and impacts over a smaller area.

MEPAS computes acute normalized dispersion values applicable to releases
of approximately an one hour duration. The standard straight-line, Gaussian
model expressed by Equation 45 is used to compute hourly concentrations
for a matrix of wind speed, wind direction, and stability conditions. Both
statistical and maximum value summaries of the short-term normalized concentrations
are provided. For a near-ground-level release, the computed hourly concentrations
combined with the frequencies of occurrence for each case (from the climatological
joint frequency dispersion summaries) are used to define the 95% and 50%
normalized air concentrations at 100 m from the source. For all types of
atmospheric releases, the maximum hourly normalized air concentration and
its location are provided for each direction. These summaries of short-term
air concentrations normalized to a unit release are provided as supplemental
information for evaluation of acute exposures.

The roughness influences on dispersion rates and wind speed tend to cancel
each other. As a result of surface-induced mechanical mixing, the local
surface roughness influences local dispersion rates. All other factors
being equal, a site with a smoother surface will appear to have smaller
dilution rates than a site with a rougher surface. However the surface
roughness will also change the near-surface wind speed; there will be faster
near-surface winds over a smooth surface compared to a rough surface. The
surface-roughness induced changes in the vertical and horizontal dilution
rates tend to be greater than the opposing change in the near-surface wind
speeds. The result is that, all other factors being equal, the estimated
acute normalized air concentrations are larger over smooth surfaces than
over rough surfaces.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The computed hourly normalized dispersion values are estimates for potential
ambient conditions that result in the maximum acute exposures. The Gaussian
model applies best to a site located on a uniform flat plane. The model
is used only as an approximation for sites located on other types of terrain.
