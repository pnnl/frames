<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
MEPAS atmospheric pathway component uses six classes of atmospheric stability
to characterize the dispersion rates. The atmospheric stability classes
are designated by the letters A to F (Slade 1968) and are commonly referred
to as the Pasquill Stability Categories (Pasquill and Smith 1983). The
classes A, B, and C stand for very unstable, unstable, and slightly unstable
conditions, respectively; D stands for a neutral condition; and E and F
stand for stable and very stable conditions, respectively. Dispersion varies
from being fastest for very unstable conditions to being slowest for very
stable conditions.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Pasquill dispersion curves used in the atmospheric component of MEPAS
are computed as a function of elapsed plume travel time. The conversion
from the distance dependence to the time dependence is based on equivalent
wind speeds. The Pasquill curves are applied as a function of time for
the conditions for which the curves were originally developed. Following
Hasse and Weber (1985), the Pasquill dispersion curves are assumed to apply
over rural English countryside (z<sub>o</sub> = 10 cm). Equations 51 and
52 are used to compute wind speeds. The plume travel time is computed as
the sum of travel times over various surfaces, thus allowing for local
wind shear effects in the dispersion computation.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The MEPAS formulation that accounts for local roughness influences is particularly
important in cases where the wind data are from a location with a quite
different surface roughness than the site. The MEPAS formulation also accounts
for changes in surface roughness in the region.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In terms of the computed dilution rate in the air, the roughness influences
on dispersion rates and wind speed tend to cancel each other. As a result
of surface-induced mechanical mixing, the local surface roughness influences
local dispersion rates and the wind speed profile. At a given distance
from the source, a site with a smoother surface will have smaller dispersion
rates and larger near-surface wind speeds than a site with a rougher surface.
The equation for computing sector-average air concentrations (Equation
47) contains the product of the vertical dispersion rate and the wind speed.
All other factors being equal, these two local surface influences almost
exactly cancel each other. The result is that the computed dilution at
a potential receptor location does not vary with the surface roughness.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Even though the dilution does not vary with surface roughness, the computed
concentrations and deposition rates will vary with surface roughness. The
roughness-induced changes in dispersion rate and wind speed directly change
the estimated deposition rates. Deposition rates indirectly change computed
air concentrations by the plume depletion rate.
