<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For
computation of long-term effects, the near-field reactions during airborne
transport are not expected to be important for most materials. However,
in special cases, the resultant plume depletion fraction is computed using
Equation 61.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Chemical reactions that are fast enough to significantly change the airborne
concentrations within the plume may be accounted for using a first-order
degradation coefficient (&euml;). The fraction of the contaminant lost
to degradation can be expressed as follows (EPA 1979):

<br>where c = chemical degradation term in Equation 51.
