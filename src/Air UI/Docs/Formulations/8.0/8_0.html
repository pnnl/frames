MEPAS is designed to consider environmental emissions of potentially hazardous
materials. When such materials are released to the atmosphere at sites
surrounded by flat uniform terrain, the atmospheric MEPAS component can
be used to compute potential airborne concentrations and surface deposition
rates. For sites with complex nonuniform surrounding terrain, additional
enhancements have been added that allow for the influence of such terrain
features. This section presents mathematical formulations and assumptions
adopted within MEPAS for complex terrain applications.

The complex terrain components described below are only approximations
of the major consequences of local terrain effects on atmospheric transport
and dispersion. In his overview of processes in complex terrain, Orgill
(1981) describes specific terrain-induced airflow phenomena over various
types of landforms along with the technical difficulty of modeling these
phenomena. Case-specific models of flow in complex terrain tend to be computer-intensive
models. However, such models were not considered appropriate for generating
the long-term average concentration patterns needed in MEPAS.
