<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Particulate fugitive releases
of contaminants are defined as emissions resulting from suspension of exposed
surface contamination by wind or mechanical processes to the air. If a
site has exposed surfaces with contamination, the potential suspension
of the contaminants depends on factors such as the physical and chemical
surface characteristics, surface contamination, ambient wind speed, turbulence,
and local mechanical activity on the surface.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A surface cover with contaminants
may be the result of either waste storage (e.g., mill tailings) or contamination
by the operation of a facility. The latter contamination may occur on natural
surfaces (e.g., soil) or artificial surfaces (e.g., concrete pads, roadways).
The potential for suspension of contaminants varies greatly because of
the wide variety of surface types and activities expected on the surfaces.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The suspension of particles
from the surface may occur as the result of wind action (Bagnold 1941;
Sehmel and Lloyd 1976) or other physical action on the surface (Sehmel
1976). Atmospheric turbulence plays a role in determining the extent to
which the air movement over the surface can suspend surface particles.
Local mechanical activity on the surface, such as animal grazing, vehicular
traffic, walking, and earth moving can greatly increase the fugitive particulate
release rates compared to an undisturbed surface.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The suspension of respirable
particles (particles with diameters less than 10 &micro;m) from contaminated
areas at DOE sites is calculated using empirical relationships based on
studies of wind erosion and surface disruption. The MEPAS outputs for suspension
from contaminated surface areas are expressed in terms of an airborne soil
concentration normalized to a unit surface contamination. These soil concentration
arrays are converted to arrays of contaminant concentrations using the
fraction of surface contamination in the suspended soil.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Computing the suspension
of contaminants from a surface into the atmosphere requires both contaminant
and site data. These data are used to define which formulations, if any,
apply to the site. If a computation is appropriate, these data are used
to compute the suspension rates.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MEPAS methodology for
computing suspension rates is an adaptation of the methodology proposed
by Cowherd et al. (1985) for rapid computation of potential long-term impacts
from spills of hazardous materials. This methodology which includes formulations
for contaminant suspension by winds, vehicular traffic, and other physical
disturbances of the surface, is similar to, but not identical to, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) AP-42 revision of the Cowherd et
al. (1985) model for industrial wind erosion (EPA 1988a, 1995).
