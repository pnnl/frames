<br><b><u>PREFACE</u></b></center>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This report is one of a
series of reports that document the mathematical models in the Multimedia
Environmental Pollutant Assessment System (MEPAS). Developed by Pacific
Northwest National Laboratory<sup>(a)</sup> for the U.S. Department of
Energy, MEPAS is an integrated impact assessment software implementation
of physics-based fate and transport models in air, soil, and water media.
Outputs are estimates of exposures and health risk assessments for radioactive
and hazardous pollutants.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the MEPAS formulation
documents covers a major MEPAS component such as atmospheric, vadose zone,
groundwater, surface water, overland, and exposure/health impact assessment.
Other MEPAS documentation reports cover the sensitivity/uncertainty formulations
and the database parameter constituent property estimation methods. The
MEPAS atmospheric component is documented in this report.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MEPAS simulates the release
of contaminants from a source, transport through the air, groundwater,
surface water, or overland pathways, and transfer through food chains and
exposure pathways to the exposed individual or population. For human health
impacts, risks are computed for carcinogens and hazard quotients for noncarcinogens.
MEPAS is implemented on a desktop computer with a user-friendly interface
that allows the user to define the problem, input the required data, and
execute the appropriate models for both deterministic and probabilistic
analyses.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Multimedia Environmental
Pollutant Assessment System (MEPAS) is an integrated software implementation
of physics-based fate and transport models for health and environmental
risk assessments of both radioactive and hazardous pollutants. This atmospheric
component report is one of a series of formulation reports that document
the MEPAS mathematical models.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MEPAS is a "multimedia"
model; pollutant transport is modeled within, through, and between multiple
media (air, soil, groundwater, and surface water). The estimated concentrations
in the various media are used to compute exposures and impacts to the environment,
to maximum individuals, and to populations.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MEPAS atmospheric component
for the air media documented in this report includes models for emission
from a source to the air, initial plume rise and dispersion, airborne pollutant
transport and dispersion, and deposition to soils and crops. The material
in this report is documentation for MEPAS Versions 3.0 and 3.1 and the
MEPAS version used in the Remedial Action Assessment System (RAAS) Version
1.0.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The atmospheric component
of MEPAS uses a series of climatological models for modeling the releases
from point and area sources. In MEPAS, emission estimation models are provided
as an alternative method for cases where the emission rates are unknown
or cannot be back-calculated from environmental monitoring data. MEPAS
has seven volatilization models for estimating gaseous vapor emissions
from various types of sources and a particle suspension model for estimating
soil-bound pollutant emissions. Plume rise models are included for stack
releases. A sector-average Gaussian model using standard dispersion rates
is used for the atmospheric transport. Both wet and dry deposition are
computed. An important enhancement is that the wind speed, dispersion,
and deposition models account for the influence of local surface roughness.
This feature allows the model to account for local roughness influences
along a wind trajectory ranging from smooth over-water to rough forest
cover. A complex-terrain nocturnal flow option allows for the near-source
channeling of airborne releases.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The major products from
these atmospheric component models include 1) contaminant emission rates,
2) regional patterns of long-term air concentrations and deposition rates
normalized by emission rates, 3) near-release short-term acute air concentrations
normalized by emission rates, 4) long-term deposition rates for selected
types of surfaces, and 5) regional patterns of ambient pollutant concentrations.
These output products from the atmospheric component are linked as input
to other components as part of the integrated MEPAS exposure and impact
evaluation software.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The development of this multimedia
contaminant environmental exposure and risk assessment methodology over
the past decade required input from a wide spectrum of engineering and
scientific technologies. The original MEPAS concept was developed by G.
Whelan and B. L. Steelman. They were joined by K. A. Higley, D. L. Strenge,
B. L. Hoopes, and the authors of this volume to form the initial MEPAS
development team.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The development of the
air component of MEPAS involved a number of staff. D. L. Strenge, and B.
L. Hoopes helped in the initial design and integration with other components.
C. D. Whiteman provided input on processes in complex terrain. S. Hwang,
J. L. Stroh, and G. P. Streile provided inputs on volatilization models.
C. J. Fosmire helped in the implementation of the formulations presented
in this document.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also wish to acknowledge
L. J. Thibodeaux for his helpful suggestions and lecture notes relative
to the modeling of volatilization from ponds.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also acknowledge valuable
inputs from the following review efforts: U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE)
Environment Survey MEPAS External Peer Review Panel, U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency's Review of Hazard Ranking Systems, Health and Welfare
Canada's Review of Multimedia Models, Hanford Single Shell Tanks Review
Panel conducted by the National Academy of Sciences, DOE's Environmental
Restoration Priority System External Review Panel, the DOE Programmatic
Environmental Impact Statement External Review Panel, and U.S. Department
of Defense's Review of Risk Prioritization Methodologies conducted by the
National Academy of Sciences.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks go to R. J. Aiken
of the DOE's Office of Environment, Safety, and Health for his support
in the early stages of development. Special thanks also go to T. P. Longo,
F. W. Baxter, P. V. Strider, K. J. Kelkenburg, P. M. Beam, and W. Wisenbaker
Jr. of the DOE Office of Environmental Management for their long-term vision
in supporting continued development and application efforts. These efforts
were conducted for the DOE under contract DE-AC06-76RLO 1830.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special thanks also go
to the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's editing and word processing
staff who made the many review drafts and this final document possible.
Their hard work, patience, and professionalism in producing versions on
very tight schedules is particularity appreciated.
