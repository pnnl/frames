MODULE VERSION
  5.0 Compiled on 8/24/2006,  UI compiled on 6/28/2007

MODULE DESCRIPTION
The MEPAS Vadose Zone Transport module simulates 
the movement of radionuclides and chemicals in a
partially saturated zone.  The migration and fate of
constituents through the vadose zone environment are
described by the one-dimensional, advective-
dispersive equation for solute transport.

Some Key Assumptions:

 1. The groundwater environment is initially free
    of constituention.
 2. All transport media properties are homogeneous
    and isotropic.
 3. Flow in the partially saturated zone is uniform.
 4. The partially saturated zone is of finite,
    constant thickness.
 5. The flow system is at steady state.
 6. Degradation/decay is first-order for all
    constituents.
 7. Dispersion transverse to the flow direction
    is negligible, so dispersion is considered
    only in the longitudinal direction.
 8. Constituent sorption processes are described
    by a constant (Kd) representing the ratio
    between the sorbed and aqueous concentrations.
 9. Decay products migrate at the same speed as
    their parent.
