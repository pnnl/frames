MODULE DESCRIPTION
GENII V.2 Air Module - Acute 95th Percentile

The GENII Acute 95th Percentile air module provides estimates
of 95th percentile ambient air concentration, dry 
and wet deposition rates, and cloud shine dose.  The
atmospheric and surface depositions are computed 
using standard Gaussian dispersion models.  The 
model can simulate a single source, located at the
center of the receptor grid, which can be either a
point or area source. The model requires hourly 
meteorological data.
