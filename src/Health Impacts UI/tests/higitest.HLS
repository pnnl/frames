    Ingestion slope factor      0.00E+00 (mg/kg/d)^-1
    Inhalation slope factor     0.00E+00 (mg/kg/d)^-1
    Unit risk factor Inhal.     0.00E+00 risk/(ug/m^3)
    Inhalation Reference dose   9.00E-02 mg/kg/day
    Ingestion Reference dose    9.00E-02 mg/kg/day
    Inhalation Reference Conc.  3.15E-01 mg/m^3

 Inhalation impacts calculated using average daily intake
 Radiation dose factors from EPA Federal Guidance  Reports No. 11 and 12 are used.
 Radionuclide consequenses will be reported as cancer incidence risk.
 Chemical health impact endpoints are evaluated based on input 
   information in the Receptor Intake File (RIF) and the following selections.
   If the RIF file does not contain information for an endpoint, it is not calculated.
 Perform chemical impact analyses for carcinogenic effects
 Perform chemical impact analyses for non-carcinogenic effects
