MEPAS Human Health Analysis Input Summary  (VERSION 14-Oct-98)
Pacific Northwest Laboratory

Developed for the U.S. Department of Energy
Run Date and Time: 09/28/99  13:53:00
Chemical toxicity data source flag = 0:
Chemical toxicity values in the MEPAS chemical database are used.
Radiation dose factors from EPA Federal Guidance  Reports No. 11 and 12 are used.
Radionuclide consequenses will be reported as radiation dose (Sv).
Slope factors from EPA HEAST reports are used for radiation risk calculations, when available.
Radionuclide consequenses will be reported as cancer incidence risk.
Because EPA HEAST slope factors have been selected,
the only risk reported will be cancer incidence.   ALL OTHER RISK OUTPUTS HAVE BEEN DISABLED.
Chemical health impact endpoints are evaluated based on input
information in the Receptor Intake File (RIF) and the following selections.
If the RIF file does not contain information for an endpoint, it is not calculated.
Perform chemical impact analyses for carcinogenic effects
Perform chemical impact analyses for non-carcinogenic effects
