<p>
The Saturated Zone component
of <b>FRAMES</b>
models solute transport through the ground water environment (i.e., partially
saturated and saturated zones).&nbsp; Specifically, this component provides
estimates of ground water constituent fluxes at various transporting medium
interfaces (e.g., water table or aquifer/river interface) and constituent
concentrations at withdrawal wells.&nbsp; Constituent fluxes at transporting
medium interfaces represent boundary conditions for the next medium in
which constituent migration and fate is to be simulated (e.g., groundwater
contamination entering a surface-water environment).&nbsp; Constituent
concentrations at withdrawal wells provide constituent levels for the exposure
assessment component of FRAMES.
<p>&nbsp;The migration and fate of constituents
through the groundwater environment are described by the three-dimensional,
advective-dispersive equation for solute transport.&nbsp; The results are
based on semianalytical solutions (i.e., solutions that require numerical
integration) that are well established in the scientific literature.&nbsp;
To increase computational efficiency, limits of integration are also identified.
<p>&nbsp;The Saturated Zone module accounts for
the major mechanisms of constituent mobility (i.e., adsorption/desorption),
persistence (i.e., degradation or decay), advection, and hydrodynamic dispersion.&nbsp;
Mobility is described by an equilibrium coefficient that assumes instantaneous
adsorption/desorption between the soil matrix and the pore water.&nbsp;
Persistence is described by a first-order degradation/decay coefficient.&nbsp;
Radionuclide decay products are also accounted for.&nbsp; Advection is
described by constant, unidirectional flow in the vertical direction in
the partially saturated (vadose) zone and in the longitudinal direction
in the saturated zone.&nbsp; Hydrodynamic dispersion is described in one
dimension for the partially saturated zone and three dimensions for the
saturated zone.
