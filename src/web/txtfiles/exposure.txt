<h2>Exposure</h2>
<p>
The exposure component of
the FRAMES system starts with pollutant concentration in a transport medium
and estimates the average daily dose to exposed individuals from contact
with the transport medium or a secondary medium contaminated by the transport
medium.&nbsp; Each exposure pathway analysis in FRAMES involves definition
of a transport medium (or medium of measurement), and exposure route for
transfer of pollutant from the transport medium to man, exposure conditions
for the individual receiving the pollutant, and conversion of the average
daily dose to a measure of health impact.&nbsp; These steps are used for
all transport and exposure pathways except exposure to measured direct
radiation fields.&nbsp; The direct radiation exposure pathway does not
involve a specific pollutant, but rather is used to estimate health impacts
from exposure to a measured radiation field.
<p>The pollutant concentration
in the transport medium is the starting point for the exposure analysis.
This concentration is generally represented as a 70-year averaged value.
When the exposure duration is less than 70 years, the concentration represents
the average for the exposure duration considered for a given exposure scenario.
Such an average value can be provided by the user for the measured soil
concentration and measured food concentration transport pathways. For other
transport pathways, the calculated 70-year average value is used as an
approximation for individual and population exposures.
<p>The transport medium
may or may not be the medium of exposure. For example, the groundwater
transport pathway generates estimates of pollutant concentration at the
well. In this case, the well water is also the medium of exposure, although
some modifications to the concentration are possible during transfer through
the treatment plant and distribution system to the individuals exposed
during domestic water uses. When the well water is used for irrigation
of agriculture crops, the exposure medium is not the well water, but the
foods produced. For agricultural pathways, models are use to estimate the
transfer of pollutants from the irrigation water to the food consumed by
humans. For each transport and exposure pathway, the processes affecting
the concentration and transfer to the exposure medium are defined in the
following sections.
<p>The models for
the exposure pathway require definition of several parameters.
<p>Six major transport pathways
may be considered including special pathways for handling exposure to measured
pollutant levels in soils and foods, and measurement of direct radiation
fields. These transport pathways and their associated exposure pathways
may indicate the transport medium, the exposure medium, and the intake
or exposure route for each exposure pathway. The discussion for a given
exposure pathway defines the transport pathways leading to the exposure
pathway, the special transfers and processes considered in determining
the pollutant concentration in the exposure medium, and the exposure model
used to estimate the average daily dose or lifetime radiation dose.
