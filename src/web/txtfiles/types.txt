<b>AIR FLUX FILE (AFF)</b></li>

<br>The air flux is a spacial average through
an exit area into unconstrained air passing by the area.&nbsp; The exit
area is normally defined by physical characteristics of the source.&nbsp;
In all cases, the exit area is the area used to define the spacial average
of the air flux.&nbsp; The air fluxes are in pCi/yr or g/yr, depending
on whether the constituent is a radionuclide or chemical.&nbsp; These flux
values are the instantaneous values at a specified time (i.e., the value
is not a time-average).&nbsp; There are NO limits on number of constituents,
progeny, fluxes, or layers.&nbsp; The number of constituent types is limited
to a maximum of 4.

<br>This file provides data for use by exposure
pathway modules for airborne releases and atmospheric transport and deposition
of pollutants.&nbsp; The following is an attempt to describe the basic
information important to the exposure pathway modules.&nbsp; The basic
data sets are provided as point values at specific locations relative to
the release point.&nbsp; Use of keywords is suggested, although other methods
of describing data types could be used (e.g., logical or integer flags).</ul>

<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The atmospheric component
uses a series of climatological models for modeling the releases from point
and area sources. In <b>FRAMES</b>, emission estimation models are provided
as an alternative method for cases where the emission rates are unknown
or cannot be back-calculated from environmental monitoring data. <b>FRAMES
</b>has
seven volatilization models for estimating gaseous vapor emissions from
various types of sources and a particle suspension model for estimating
soil-bound pollutant emissions. Plume rise models are included for stack
releases. A sector-average Gaussian model using standard dispersion rates
is used for the atmospheric transport. Both wet and dry deposition are
computed. An important enhancement is that the wind speed, dispersion,
and deposition models account for the influence of local surface roughness.
This feature allows the model to account for local roughness influences
along a wind trajectory ranging from smooth over-water to rough forest
cover. A complex-terrain nocturnal flow option allows for the near-source
channeling of airborne releases.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The major products from
these atmospheric component models include 1) constituent emission rates,
2) regional patterns of long-term air concentrations and deposition rates
normalized by emission rates, 3) near-release short-term acute air concentrations
normalized by emission rates, 4) long-term deposition rates for selected
types of surfaces, and 5) regional patterns of ambient pollutant concentrations.
These output products from the atmospheric component are linked as input
to other components as part of the integrated exposure and impact evaluation
software.
<p>The atmospheric pathway
component estimates the pollutant exposures from atmospheric emissions
to a regional human population. Long-term, average constituent levels are
computed using standard computation techniques for locations defined in
terms of a direction and distance from the site. Using these methods, estimates
of constituent levels for exposure assessment can be made for both population
centers and less populated rural areas. Short-term normalized air concentrations
are provided for evaluation of acute exposures at nearby locations.

<img src="images/icon_exposure.jpg" ALT="Exposure" align=left><font size=+1><b>Exposure</b></font>
<br>
The exposure component of
the FRAMES system starts with pollutant concentration in a transport medium
and estimates the average daily dose to exposed individuals from contact
with the transport medium or a secondary medium contaminated by the transport
medium.&nbsp; Each exposure pathway analysis in FRAMES involves definition
of a transport medium (or medium of measurement), and exposure route for
transfer of pollutant from the transport medium to man, exposure conditions
for the individual receiving the pollutant, and conversion of the average
daily dose to a measure of health impact.&nbsp; These steps are used for
all transport and exposure pathways except exposure to measured direct
radiation fields.&nbsp; The direct radiation exposure pathway does not
involve a specific pollutant, but rather is used to estimate health impacts
from exposure to a measured radiation field.
<p>The pollutant concentration
in the transport medium is the starting point for the exposure analysis.
This concentration is generally represented as a 70-year averaged value.
When the exposure duration is less than 70 years, the concentration represents
the average for the exposure duration considered for a given exposure scenario.
Such an average value can be provided by the user for the measured soil
concentration and measured food concentration transport pathways. For other
transport pathways, the calculated 70-year average value is used as an
approximation for individual and population exposures.
<p>The transport medium
may or may not be the medium of exposure. For example, the groundwater
transport pathway generates estimates of pollutant concentration at the
well. In this case, the well water is also the medium of exposure, although
some modifications to the concentration are possible during transfer through
the treatment plant and distribution system to the individuals exposed
during domestic water uses. When the well water is used for irrigation
of agriculture crops, the exposure medium is not the well water, but the
foods produced. For agricultural pathways, models are use to estimate the
transfer of pollutants from the irrigation water to the food consumed by
humans. For each transport and exposure pathway, the processes affecting
the concentration and transfer to the exposure medium are defined in the
following sections.
<p>The models for
the exposure pathway require definition of several parameters.
<p>Six major transport pathways
may be considered including special pathways for handling exposure to measured
pollutant levels in soils and foods, and measurement of direct radiation
fields. These transport pathways and their associated exposure pathways
may indicate the transport medium, the exposure medium, and the intake
or exposure route for each exposure pathway. The discussion for a given
exposure pathway defines the transport pathways leading to the exposure
pathway, the special transfers and processes considered in determining
the pollutant concentration in the exposure medium, and the exposure model
used to estimate the average daily dose or lifetime radiation dose.

<br>
Health impact models are used
to estimate the health impacts from exposure to the pollutant of concern.
Models are defined for noncarcinogenic chemicals, carcinogenic chemicals,
and radionuclides and radiation dose. When populations are exposed to carcinogenic
pollutants, including radiation, estimates of health impacts to an exposed
population may also be made by multiplication of the effect to an average
member of the population by the number of people in the exposed population.
<p>Human health impacts are
estimated from the average daily dose provided by the exposure pathway
models.&nbsp; Impacts from radiation exposure (radionuclides and measured
direct radiation), carcinogenic chemicals, and noncarcinogenic chemicals
are estimated.&nbsp; Health impact assessments for exposure of an individual
or an average member of the population are estimated.
<p>Health impacts from exposure
to radiation and radionuclides are expressed as the risk of developing
cancer. This risk may be reported as the lifetime risk of total cancer
incidence or as cancer fatalities. Two methods are available to estimate
the risk of cancer fatalities: use of health- effects conversion factors
and use of USEPA slope factors.
<p>The lifetime risk of total
cancer incidence is estimated using USEPA slope factors for chemical carcinogens
for inhalation and ingestion exposure pathways. Dermal exposures are evaluated
as equivalent ingestion intakes as described in the sections on dermal
absorption pathways. The USEPA slope factors give the lifetime cancer incidence
risk per average daily dose.
<p>The health impacts for
exposure to noncarcinogenic chemicals are expressed as a hazard quotient.
The hazard quotient is the ratio of the average daily dose to the reference
dose. The reference dose is defined by the USEPA for many chemicals for
ingestion and inhalation intakes (USEPA 1993). The reference dose represents
a level that is believed to be safe for members of the general population.
Exposure at this level will result in a hazard quotient of 1.0.
<p>Health impacts from exposure
to carcinogenic chemicals and radionuclides can be estimated for the entire
exposed population. For these pollutants, the population health impacts
are assumed to be proportional to the exposure level. This allows a population
health impact to be evaluated as the product of the lifetime risk to the
average member of the population times the number of people in the population.

<br>
The ground water component
of <b>FRAMES</b>
models solute transport through the groundwater environment (i.e., partially
saturated and saturated zones).&nbsp; Specifically, this component provides
estimates of groundwater constituent fluxes at various transporting medium
interfaces (e.g., water table or aquifer/river interface) and constituent
concentrations at withdrawal wells.&nbsp; constituent fluxes at transporting
medium interfaces represent boundary conditions for the next medium in
which constituent migration and fate is to be simulated (e.g., groundwater
contamination entering a surface-water environment).&nbsp; constituent
concentrations at withdrawal wells provide constituent levels for the exposure
assessment component of FRAMES.
<p>&nbsp;The migration and fate of constituents
through the groundwater environment are described by the three-dimensional,
advective-dispersive equation for solute transport.&nbsp; The results are
based on semianalytical solutions (i.e., solutions that require numerical
integration) that are well established in the scientific literature.&nbsp;
To increase computational efficiency, limits of integration are also identified.
<p>&nbsp;The groundwater model accounts for
the major mechanisms of constituent mobility (i.e., adsorption/desorption),
persistence (i.e., degradation or decay), advection, and hydrodynamic dispersion.&nbsp;
Mobility is described by an equilibrium coefficient that assumes instantaneous
adsorption/desorption between the soil matrix and the pore water.&nbsp;
Persistence is described by a first-order degradation/decay coefficient.&nbsp;
Radionuclide decay products are also accounted for.&nbsp; Advection is
described by constant, unidirectional flow in the vertical direction in
the partially saturated (vadose) zone and in the longitudinal direction
in the saturated zone.&nbsp; Hydrodynamic dispersion is described in one
dimension for the partially saturated zone and three dimensions for the
saturated zone.

<img src="images/icon_river.jpg" ALT="Surface Water" align=left><font size=+1><b>Surface Water</b></font>
<br>
Surface Water is one component
of the FRAMES system.&nbsp; Of the many types of surface water bodies (e.g.,
nontidal rivers, estuaries, lakes, open coasts, reservoirs, impoundments,
etc.) in which constituent fate and transport could be simulated, only
a nontidal river model is currently incorporated. Nontidal rivers refer
to freshwater bodies with unidirectional flow in definable channels.&nbsp;
Other surface water models can be added when deemed necessary.
<p>The surface water component
provides estimates of constituent concentrations in a river at locations
downstream from a release point.&nbsp; The computed constituent concentrations
are used by the exposure assessment component of FRAMES to calculate dose
and the resulting health effects to the surrounding population.&nbsp; Potential
exposure of humans to constituents via rivers can be associated with ingestion
(e.g., drinking contaminated water), inhalation of volatile pollutants
(e.g., showering), dermal contact to chemicals (e.g., swimming), or external
dose from radionuclides (e.g., swimming).
<p>Because annual-average
constituent releases to a river are relatively long term compared to typical
constituent travel times in a river, the migration and fate of constituents
through the riverine pathway are described by the steady-state, two-dimensional
advective-dispersive equation for solute transport.&nbsp; The results are
based on an analytical solution that is well established in the scientific
literature.&nbsp; The surface water equation accounts for the major mechanisms
of constituent persistence (i.e., degradation/decay), advection, and hydrodynamic
dispersion.&nbsp; Persistence is described by a first-order degradation/decay
coefficient.&nbsp; Radionuclide decay products are also accounted for.&nbsp;
Advection is described by constant unidirectional flow in the longitudinal
direction.&nbsp; Hydrodynamic dispersion is accounted for in the lateral
direction.&nbsp; The processes associated with adsorption/desorption between
the water column and suspended and bed sediments are not addressed.&nbsp;
Neglecting these processes should, in most cases, represent a conservative
assumption with regard to water column constituent concentrations.
<br>Contamination can enter
the riverine environment in one of three ways.&nbsp; The groundwater pathway
can supply transient constituent fluxes along the stream bank adjacent
to the aquifer.&nbsp; Overland runoff can supply nonpoint-source constituent
fluxes from the land adjacent to the stream.&nbsp; Finally, the surface
water component of FRAMES allows direct discharges to the stream.

<br>
The <b>FRAMES</b> source-term
release module includes models for estimating constituent loss from three
different types of source zones: contaminated aquifer, contaminated pond/surface
impoundment, and contaminated vadose zone. In all types of constituent
source zones, it is assumed that the constituents may be present in multiple
phases (i.e., in aqueous solution, sorbed to solid particles, in vapor-filled
pore space, or in a separate non-aqueous-phase liquid [NAPL] that is immiscible
with water and air). The source-term release module contains models to
determine which constituents in the problem scenario will partition into
which phases, and to what degree. Depending on the type of source zone,
it is assumed that the processes causing constituent release from the source
zone to an environmental transport pathway could be leaching (groundwater
pathway), wind suspension (atmospheric pathway), water erosion (overland/surface
water pathway), overland flow (overland/surface water pathway), and/or
volatilization (atmospheric pathway). In addition, constituents could be
lost from the source zone by radioactive decay or degradation within the
zone. The source-term release module contains models for simulating "baseline"
(i.e., unremediated) scenarios for all three types of source zones. These
same models can be used to simulate remediated sites (for all three types
of source zones) if the remediation methodology can be represented merely
by changing the magnitude of certain model parameters from their "baseline"
values. In addition, for the vadose zone source zone, the source-term release
module contains models that can calculate loss fluxes from vadose zones
subjected to two types of remediation methodologies that require special
theory:
<br>in situ vitrification (ISV) and in situ
solidification (ISS).
<p> The ultimate objective of the
source-term release component is to calculate a "mass-budgeted" set of
constituent flux versus time functions that describe the simultaneous loss
of constituents from the source zone to a number of different routes. When
multiple loss processes are assumed to occur simultaneously, the mathematical
models implemented in the source-term release module account for their
synergistic or antagonistic interaction. "Mass-budgeted" means that the
inventory of each constituent is apportioned to each loss route (by the
implemented physics-based theory) in a manner such that the sum of the
calculated constituent losses to all routes is limited to 100% of the initial
inventory. The source-term release module has been developed to allow the
user flexibility in how the constituent release to different routes is
simulated. If the user wishes to explicitly enter the constituent flux
to one or more loss routes (based on known or assumed data, or the predictions
of some other model), the source-term release component will use the supplied
flux versus time function(s) until mass balance considerations dictate
that the flux must go to zero (because cumulative constituent mass loss
to all routes has removed 100% of the initial inventory). If the user cannot
or does not wish to supply explicit constituent fluxes to any or all loss
routes, the source-term release component contains models that will calculate
the flux verses time functions (also according to mass balance considerations).
If the user wants to analyze a scenario that assumes constituent release
to only a subset of the possible loss routes for a given type of source
zone, loss to undesired routes can be "turned off" by specifying a known
flux of zero to those routes.

This <b>FRAMES</b> component, Vadose Zone,
is a fate and transport module that models constituent behavior in the
subsurface above the ground water; may receive input from source modules;
provides input to the aquifer module.&nbsp; There are different types of
Vadose Zone including silt and clay.&nbsp; To model the site, more than
one vadose module can be attached to the case demonstrating the differing
levels of subsurface.

<br>The flux is a spacial average through a
rectangular plane segment that is the interface between one layer and the
next.&nbsp; The fluxes are in pCi/yr or g/yr, depending on whether the
constituent is a radionuclide or chemical.&nbsp; These flux values are

<br>Unlike many other files in the framework,
the parameter file contains all the data the user inputs.&nbsp; These data,
because they may be changed at will by the user, need to be able to be
changed or added to in an efficient way.</ul>
