<h2>Requirements for FRAMES Specification File
Viewer Modules</h2>

<p><b>1.0 Introduction</b>
<p>This document describes the default set of specification viewer modules
for FRAMES. The following sections describe the purpose of viewers, summarizes
their overall requirements, and input, output and mathematical requirements.
The viewers are designed specifically as objects for inclusion into
FRAMES software, which is a platform that allows for linking of various
multimedia modules into complete transport/exposure assessment systems
(Whelan et al. 1997). Software engineers and testers can use these requirements
to ensure these viewer modules meet needs of clients and users.
<p><b>2.0 Purpose of Specification File Viewer Modules</b>
<p>The purpose of the default set of specification file viewer modules
is to allow FRAMES users to view&nbsp; default set of file types specified
by FRAMES software both in original text format and graphical format.
Input to modules consists of each of data file types specified
by FRAMES (SCF, AFF, WFF, ATO, WCF, EPF, RIF, HIF, and SUF). Output consists
of both a text format and graphical display of data contained in file.&nbsp;
following are nine (9) file types and their respective descriptions.
<p>2.0.1<u> Soil Concentration File (SCF)</u>
<p>The Soil Concentration File contains concentrations have been spatially
averaged throughout volume of soil zone. concentrations are
in pCi/mL or g/mL (pCi/Kg or g/Kg in vadose zone) depending on whether
constituent is a radionuclide or chemical. These concentration values
are instantaneous values at a specified time, not average.
<p>2.0.2<u> Atmospheric Flux File (AFF)</u>
<p>The Atmospheric Flux File contains air fluxes have been spatially
averaged through exit area into unconstrained air passing by area.
exit area is normally defined by physical characteristics of source.
In all cases, exit area is area used to define spatial average
of air flux. The air fluxes are in pCi/yr or g/yr depending on whether
constituent is a radionuclide or chemical. These flux values are
instantaneous values at a specified time (i.e. value is not a time-average).
<p>2.0.3<u> Water Flux File (WFF)</u>
<p>The Water Flux File contains water fluxes have been spatially averaged
through a rectangular plane segment is interface between one waterborne
media layer and next. The fluxes are in pCi/yr or g/yr depending on
whether constituent is a radionuclide or chemical. These flux values
are instantaneous values at a given time not average.
<p>2.0.4<u> Atmospheric Concentration File (ATO)</u>
<p>The Atmospheric Concentration File contains air concentrations in kg-s/m3
or Bq-s/m3, deposition rates in kg/m2/s or Bq/m2/s, and external dose in
Sv depending on whether constituent is a radionuclide or chemical.
These values can be stored in one of two coordinate systems, polar or Cartesian.
amount of data can either be a point, multiple points, or a grid of
data.
<p>2.0.5<u> Water Concentration File (WCF)</u>
<p>The Water Concentration File contains concentrations in pCi/ml or g/ml
depending on whether the constituent is a radionuclide or chemical. These
concentration values are instantaneous values at given time not
average at location specified.
<p>2.0.6<u> Exposure Pathway File (EPF)</u>
<p>The Exposure Pathway File contains the concentration of each constituent
for a given route and pathway. Exposure concentration are in Bq/kg or Bq/l
for radionuclides, mg/kg or mg/l for chemicals, and Sv for external dose.
The available exposure pathways are air, indoor air, ground, leafy vegetables,
root vegetables, fruit, Grain, beef, poultry, milk, eggs, soil, swimming,
boating, shoreline, water, fish, mollusks, crustacea, aquatic plants, showering,
and other. The available exposure routes are ingestion, inhalation, dermal
contact, and external dose.
<p>2.0.7<u> Receptor Intake File (RIF)</u>
<p>The Receptor Intake File contains the chosen receptor's intake of each
constituent in Bq, mg/kg/d or Sv depending on whether constituent is
a radionuclide or chemical. This information is stored based on constituents
exposure pathway and route to receptor. The available exposure pathways
are: air, indoor air, ground, leafy vegetables, root vegetables, fruit,
grain, beef, poultry, milk, eggs, soil, swimming, boating, shoreline, water,
fish, mollusks, crustacea, aquatic plants, showering, and other. The available
exposure routes are ingestion, inhalation, dermal contact, and external
dose.
<p>2.0.8<u> Health Impact File (HIF)</u>
<p>The Health Impact File contains the chosen receptor's impact from constituent
in Risk or Hazard Index (HI) depending on whether constituent is a
radionuclide, chemical carcinogen or chemical non-carcinogen. This determination
is based on health impact defined as risk of developing cancer
(either as total incidence or fatal incidence), or incidence of severe
genetic effects. This information is stored based on constituents exposure
pathway and route to receptor. The available exposure pathways are
air, indoor air, ground, leafy vegetables, root vegetables, fruit, grain,
beef, poultry, milk, eggs, soil, swimming, boating, shoreline, water, fish,
mollusks, crustacea, aquatic plants, showering, and other. available
exposure routes are ingestion, inhalation, dermal contact, and external
dose.
<p>For radionuclides, health impacts are expressed as risk of developing
cancer, either as total incidence, fatal incidence, or incidence of severe
genetic effects.

<p>The Sensitivity/Uncertainty File contains a sample set of input variables
and calculated output variables for each statistical realization.
