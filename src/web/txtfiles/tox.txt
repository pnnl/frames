<h2>Toxicity Factors</h2>
<br><b>Inhalation Slope Factor (mg/kg/d)^-1:</b>
<br>
<br>The inhalation slope factor for chemicals provides an estimate of the cancer incidence risk from inhalation of a chemical. The value is the risk normalize to unit average daily intake rate (mg/kg/d). Values are based on unit cancer risk values published in EPAs Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), with conversion for exposure at 24 hours per day and 20 m^3/d of air inhaled.
<br>
<br><b>Ingestion Slope Factor (mg/kg/d)^-1:</b>
<br>
<br>The ingestion slope factor for chemicals provides an estimate of the cancer incidence risk from ingestion of a chemical. The value is the risk normalized to unit average daily intake rate (mg/kg/d). Most values in the database are based on values published in EPAs Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS). A few values are based on "equivalent toxicity" considerations between the chemical of concern and other chemicals with similar physical and chemical properties.
<br>
<br><b>Inhalation Reference Dose (mg/kg/d):</b>
<br>
<br>The inhalation reference dose represents an average daily inhalation exposure rate that is considered to pose no risk to the population. The primary source of values is IRIS. The IRIS values are expressed as inhalation reference concentrations which are converted to inhalation reference doses for exposure at 24 hours per day and 20 m^3/d of air inhaled. A secondary source of inhalation reference doses involves conversion of "threshold limit values" (TLVs) to reference doses by accounting for differences in exposure conditions between workers and the general population.
<br>
<br><b>Ingestion Reference Dose (mg/kg/d):</b>
<br>
<br>The ingestion reference dose represents an average daily ingestion exposure rate that is considered to pose no risk to the population. Values in the database are based on values published in IRIS. For values not available from IRIS, HEAST, or other EPA reports, estimates are made using oral LD50 values published in the literature.
