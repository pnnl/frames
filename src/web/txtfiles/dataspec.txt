For the Data Client/Editor UI 
================================================================================

DES File for the different data sets
The UI executable entry in the DES file will contain the URL for the desired database. For eaxmple the first two lines of the DES file should look something like this:

  mf,Version 2.0
  Ecology,FRAMES Default Data Editor,dataedit.exe http://mepas.pnl.gov:2080/extract.asp,

The rest of the file will be as stated in the FRAME specifications document.  The commandline for the Data Client/Editor will be as follows:

	[executable] [URL] [FUI File] [Run File] [Site Index] [Model Index] [Model ID]

for example:

	c:\frames\dataedit.exe http://mepas.pnl.gov:2080/extract.asp c:\frames\dodscen5 c:\frames\~tmp 1 1 eco1

The DCE will strip the number off the model ID and append .dic and prepend the DCE executable path to obtain the .DIC file that contains the primary key and dictionary information.

===============================================================================
Dictionary File
================================================================================

	The data dictionary file consists of three types of information: 1) the number of variable lines, 2) a field header line, and 3) the variable data description lines. A data dictionary file is a comma delimited text file that contains the data about the data (sometimes referred to as meta data) that is contained in a particular FRAMES data set. The first line of the dictionary file contains the number of variables listed within the dictionary, the name of the dataset, and FRAMES primary keys. The number of variables includes the one-line field header, along with the number of actual variables in the file (i.e., 35 variables would have 36 lines). The second line of the file contains the field header of the file, which is comprised of the following fields: 

Field Name				Definition
==============			=========================
  "Code"					Variable Name (String)
  "Dimensions"			Dimensionality (Integer)
  "Data Type"			Type of data (String)  ["Logical"],["Integer"],["Real"],["String"]
  "Min"						Minimum value/length for variable (Double)
  "Max"						Maximum value/length for variable (Double)
  "Units"					Units of variable
  "Description"		Description of variable
  "Key1"					First indexing key of variable
  "Key2"					Second indexing key of variable
  ...						More indexing key varibles if needed


Following the field head line are the N number of description lines, where N is defined by the number of varibles minus one specified in the first of the file.  A description line consists of the "Code," "Dimensions," "Data Type," "Min," "Max," and "Units" specific for the variable. After the "Units" field are the "Description," "Key1," "Key2," "Key3," "Key4," "Key5," and "Key6" fields.   Following the field header is the information for the variable corresponding to the fields header for each variable. Each line contains all of the description data for one variable.

	The "Code" field contains the code or name for each variable in the file. "Code" field entries are character strings limited to a maximum of 20 characters per field. The "Dimensions" field contains an integer denoting the number of dimensions associated with the variable. The number of dimensions of a variable must be within the range of zero to six.  The "Data Type" field is a set of character strings that are limited to "float," "integer," "string," or "logic."  Both the "Min" and "Max" fields contain floating-point numbers that are used to set an upper and lower limit upon the values assigned to the variable or in the case of strings the minimum and maximum length of the string. The "Units" field of the dictionary contains a string of characters denoting the units of measure for the variable.  While the units may be of any type, a maximum length of 20 characters limits the character string representing the units. The "Description" field is used to hold a textual description of the variable. The description field is represented by a string of characters that may be of any length including zero. The fields "key1" through "key6" are character strings used to reference an indexing key variable for each dimension of the variable. The character strings used by the key description fields may contain a maximum of 20 characters. The following is an example of a data dictionary file.
	
8,
"Code","Dimensions","DataType","Min","Max","Units","Description", "key1", "key2", "key3", "key4", "key5", "key6" 
"NumYears",0,Integer,0,,,"Number of years in simulation",
"Years",1,"FLOAT",0,,"yr","Simulation year","NumYears"
"NumLocation",0,Integer,0,,,"Number of years in simulation",
"Location",1,"STRING",0,,,"Name of location","NumLocation"
"VapDep",2,"FLOAT",0,100000,"g/yr","Location","Year"
"ParDDep",2,"FLOAT",0,100000,"g/yr","Location","Year"
"PM10",2,"FLOAT",0,100000,"g/yr","Location","Year"



===============================================================================
DOT, Data Server, Data Client
================================================================================

DOT will read the data dictionary to determine the key(s) needed for extraction. The keys will be placed starting in the eight column all keys starting with "Num" should be ignored.  For all others an extraction plan should be developed and the Data Client/Editor should ask for.  Any parameter in the dictionary that starts with "Num" need not have an extraction plan.  As this parameter will be filled in by the Data Clinet/Editor.


Resquest for a Key List
A key list request has the form of:
  URL/extract.asp/step=keylist$key=[somekeyname]

where URL is the domain name of the server and 
somekeyname is one of the keys in the dictionary

for example
  URL/extract.asp/step=keylist$key=lifeform

Format of a response to a key list request should list the key values with a count. The list should be comma separated. A key list response has the format of:
  Count,"Key Value Name","Key Value Name",...


Request for Data Item(s)
A data item request has the form of:
  URL/extract.asp?step=extract?[querystring]

where URL is the domain name of the server and querystring is equal to a combination of the following:
keys=      the number of keys
key1=      the first key
key2=      the second key
val1=      the first key value
val2=      the second key value 
parm=      the name of the parameter to be retrieved

for example:
  URL/extract.asp?step=extract?keys=2?key1=chemical?key2=lifeform?val1=SR90?val2=frog?parm=deathrate

Format of a response to a key list request should list the parameter values with a count.  The record fields should be comma separated. Records should be sperated by a line feed.  A key list response has the format of:
Count,
"Value"
"Value"
...
