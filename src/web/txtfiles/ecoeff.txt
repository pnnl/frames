<p>

The Ecological Effects Component of FRAMES correlates simulated, modeled, or measured ecological
constituent levels (e.g., concentration, body burden, dose) with toxicological benchmarks and provides a
statistical analysis of this comparison.
<p>
Ecological Effects takes in Ecological Benchmark Database data and time-varying constituent concentrations from Surface Water and connects to an ecological exposure component of FRAMES.

<p>
Ecological Effects module produces two types of output each for time-varying concentrations and/or doses/body burdens.  The two forms of outputs are as follows:
<br>1. When consuming information from a WCF, WEAP shall produce a table, computing acute (e.g., #96-
hr) and chronic exposures (e.g., >96-hr), for percentage of time that a time series of
concentrations, doses, or body burdens are
a. below an acceptable limit (e.g., Chronic Limit, Criterion Continuous Concentration [CCC],
No Observable Effects Level [NOEL], No Observable Adverse Effects Level [NOAEL],
etc.)
<br>b. above an unacceptable limit (e.g., exposure duration curves associated with Lethal
Concentration for 50% mortality [LC-50], Lethal Dose for 50% mortality [LD-50], Effective
Dose at 50% [ED-50], etc.)
<br>c. in between acceptable and unacceptable limits.
This table will result in a maximum of six values.
<br>2. When consuming information from a WCF, WEAP shall produce a table reporting Probability of
Exceedence, based on Period of Record (i.e., assumed equal to Exposure Duration) versus
Concentration: probability that concentration will be equal to or greater than a selected value.
<br>3. When consuming a BBF, WEAP shall produce a table reporting Ecological Hazard Quotient
(EHQ) versus time. EHQ is defined as ratio of the body burden to a benchmark dose.
<br>4. When consuming an BBF, WEAP shall produce a table reporting Probability of Exceedence,
based on Period of Record (i.e., assumed equal to Exposure Duration) versus EHQ:
probability that an EHQ will be equal to or greater than a selected value.
<br>5. When consuming an BBF, WEAP shall produce a table reporting Probability of Exceedence,
based on Period of Record (i.e., assumed equal to Exposure Duration) versus Dose or Body
Burden: probability that the dose/body burden will be equal to or greater than a selected value.

<p> Ecological Effects statistically analyzes time-varying water-column concentrations and compares these results to
ecological benchmarks to determine health impacts to selected lifeforms. It tabularizes percentage
of time that a lifeform is associated with an ecological health impact region for a given chemical, based on
<Br>1) time-varying water-column concentrations,
<br>2) an impact-toxicity benchmark curve (e.g., percent mortality
LC curve), and
<Br>3) lower acceptable limit curve.
