   <h2>New in FRAMES 1.3</h2><p>

The following are lists of the most significant additions and changes made from the FRAMES version 1.2 to the FRAMES version 1.3:<p>
<P>Additions to FRAMES 1.3:
<UL>
  <LI>Five new Human Health Impact (HIF) viewers including a tabular viewer that
  sums risks/hazards for all exposure pathways, routes, and media for a starting
  point in time, location, constituent, age group, and target organ, and can be
  categorized by three sets of health metric:&nbsp; a) risk from carcinogenic
  chemicals, b) hazard from noncarcinogenic chemicals, and c) risk from
  radionuclides.
  <LI>A Risk Assessment Guidelines for Superfund (RAGS) table generation viewer
  that will enable FRAMES system to generate tables required for a RAGS
  analysis as prescribed by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
</LI></UL>
<P><BR>Changes to FRAMES 1.3:
<UL>
  <LI>Opening and closing files - Upon first opening FRAMES software, a
  blank screen (instead of a new .gid file) will open. This forces the user to
  either create a new file or select a file already existing. Also, software
  will prompt the user to save the file immediately after creating the file,
  instead of saving it upon entering data for the Constituent Database module
  icon.
  <LI>Viewers - To view results, right click on the item menu for each icon and
  choose "View/Print Module Input." The viewer is no longer an icon that needs
  to be attached within the CSM (Conceptual Site Model).
  <LI>Constituent Editor now allows users to modify constituent
  properties local to a GID, or to all subsequent runs using FRAMES
  constituent database.
  <LI>Increased speed for file input and output.
  <LI>Error message handling has been improved.
  <LI>Module connectivity and status light system are more robust.
  <LI>Backing up of scenario files has been improved.&nbsp; Original files
  are restored when the GID is closed without saving.
  <LI>Sensitivity/Uncertainty module is faster and now works with all
  modules that have defined their inputs in their respective DES files, although
  it still limited to monitoring SCF, WFF, WCF, HIF outputs. </LI></UL>
