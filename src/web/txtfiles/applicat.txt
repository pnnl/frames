<h2>CASE STUDIES AND APPLICATIONS</h2>


<br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>This software
platform was developed with problem-solving in mind and is application-oriented.
FRAMES combines the best of both government and industrial technical knowledge
and expertise and has been independently reviewed for technicality and
usability. Several of FRAMES applications are described as follows:</font></font></font>
<blockquote>
<li>
<font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>FRAMES has been
used for the Baseline Risk Assessment at the DOE Pantex Plant in Texas.
A site-specific groundwater transport code was linked into FRAMES and its
models to conduct a source to impacts analysis. A client lauded the work
 because of the quality results and efficient use of modeling resources</font></font></font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>The FRAMES concept
was a critical component of EPA's Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR).
FRAMES concepts were used to integrate selected fate, transport, exposure,
and impact codes to develop nation-wide regulatory information. The EPA
client awarded Battelle the highest technical and management marks possible.</font></font></font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>FRAMES has been
applied at several DOD sites that have been contaminated with an assortment
of chemicals. FRAMES allowed Battelle staff to link their suite of environmental
codes with client-preferred codes to provide the appropriate modeling system
for the specific application. DOD has repeatedly come back to Battelle
because of its unique capabilities and service.</font></font></font></li>
