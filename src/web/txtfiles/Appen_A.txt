            <h2>QA/QC Appendix A, PNNL-11880</h2><p>
			<b>Guidance for Designing, Developing, Testing, and Implementing
			Environmental Software Systems</b>

			<p>For each new or modified system or module, the project
			team follows the general process described below. Each step in the process
			has its own guidance to project staff.
			<p><b>Step 1—Requirements Analysis (Section 3.1)</b>
			<br>&nbsp;
			<table border=0 bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="90%">

			</tr>
			</table>

			The subject matter expert (SME) leads team members in determining what the
			requirements are for the module or framework. The resulting requirements
			package should list requirements in general categories, breaking each category
			down into sufficient detail that the custodians and code developers will
			clearly understand what is expected as an outcome for the software. This
			breakdown can be documented in the form of an outline or work breakdown
			structure. When the requirements package is completed, the subject
			matter expert provides a copy to the project custodian and the module or
			framework custodian.
			<p><b>Step 2-Step 4—System Design and Development (Section
			3.2)</b>
			<p><b>Step 2</b>
			<br>&nbsp;
				<table border=0 bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="90%">
			<tr>
			<td><img SRC="images/step2.gif" ALT="step 2"></td>

			<td><font color="#000080" face="Verdana" size="2"></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
            The framework or module custodian (depending on whether a framework
			or module is being developed) leads the code developers in determining
			what kinds of software components and coding must be developed to meet
			the requirements. Every requirement level and sub-level should be addressed.
			The requirements can be addressed using a matrix that lists software components
			or processes next to requirement or in a database that connects correlates
			requirements with design elements. These design elements should be specified
			sufficiently clearly to allow understanding by all members of the development
			team.
			<p><b>Step 3</b>
			<br>&nbsp;
				<table border=0 bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="90%">
			<tr>
			<td><img SRC="images/step3.gif" ALT="step 3"></td>

			<td><font color="#000080" face="Verdana" size="2"> </td>
			</tr>
			</table>
            The subject matter expert(SME) and framework or module custodian (depending
			on whether a framework or module is being developed) meet to confirm relationships
			between and the "whats" and the "hows". At this time the subject matter expert
			and custodian decide on a ranking of both the requirements and related
			design elements to ensure the development process addresses the more critical
			items before others. This information is added to the software development
			package and the database that was used to match the requirements and design
			elements previously.&nbsp;
			<p><b>Step 4</b>
			<br>&nbsp;
				<table border=0 bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="90%">
			<tr>
			<td><img SRC="images/step4.gif" ALT="step 4"></td>

			<td><font color="#000080" face="Verdana" size="2"></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
            The framework or module custodian (depending on whether a framework
			or module is being developed) reviews the design elements confirmed by
			the subject matter expert (SME) in Step 3 to determine whether they are dependent,
			have positive relationships, or are mutually exclusive and therefore, likely
			cause difficulties in implementation. This information is also added to
			the software development package and the database that was used to match
			the requirements and elements previously. In addition, at this point, the
			framework or module custodian should address the finer points of the design
			for the software development package. The process of evaluating the current
			set of design elements by asking the question "how will each of these elements
			be address?" is often used to breakdown the design into workable sections
			that can then be assigned to code developers.
			<p><b>Step 5—System Integration, Testing, and Evaluation
			(Section 5.0)</b>
			<br>&nbsp;
				<table border=0 bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="90%">
			<tr>
			<td><img SRC="images/step5.gif" ALT="step 5"></td>

			<td><font color="#000080" face="Verdana" size="2"></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
            The application expert leads the testers and technical reviewers in
			answering the question: "How will we know the software works?" They focus
			on both the design elements and the requirements, allowing both to be tested.
			The test package may contain the following information:
			<p><b>Step 6—System Design and Development (Section 3.2)</b>
			<br>&nbsp;
				<table border=0 bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="90%">
			<tr>
			<td><img SRC="images/step6.gif" ALT="step 6"></td>

			<td><font color="#000080" face="Verdana" size="2"></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			The framework developers implement the design elements identified in
			previous steps. When finished, they complete the software development package.

			<p><b>Step 7—System Integration, Testing, and Evaluation
			(Section 5.0)</b>
			<br>&nbsp;
				<table border=0 bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="90%">
			<tr>
			<td><img SRC="images/step7.gif" ALT="step 7"></td>

			<td><font color="#000080" face="Verdana" size="2"></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
            The application expert leads the testers and technical reviewers in
			running the tests and determining whether the results are acceptable in
			ensuring that the software will meet client requirements. The results of
			the tests and any modifications made to the module or framework as a result
			of the tests are included in the development package and software test
			package then submitted to the project custodian.
			<p><b>Step 8—System Implementation (Section 6.0)</b>
			<br>&nbsp;
				<table border=0 bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="90%">
			<tr>
			<td><img SRC="images/step8.gif" ALT="step 8"></td>

			<td><font color="#000080" face="Verdana" size="2"></td>
			</tr>
			</table>
            The subject matter expert is responsible for determining if the software
			is ready to be delivered to the client. This involved confirming the completeness
			of the requirements package, the development package, and the software
			test package. Any technology transfer, implementation support, and training
			are determined and implemented in this step.&nbsp;
			<p>Throughout the above Steps additional information or clarification
			can send the process back to any previous step. From that entry point,
			however, the steps must be completed in order. For example, an additional
			client need identified in step 7 will send the team back to enhance the
			existing information in Step 1. From there the team will progress to Step
			2, 3 and so on. Although the process is defined the time spent in each
			step is determined by the additional information and its affects on the
			software system. This approach will allow for the flexibility of accepting
additional information with the traceability of a well defined process.
