FRAMES 1.3 has added five new Human Health Impact (HIF) viewers including a tabular viewer that sums risks/hazards for all exposure pathways, routes, and media for a starting point in time, location, constituent, age group, and target organ, and can be categorized by three sets of health metric: a) risk from carcinogenic chemicals, b) hazard from noncarcinogenic chemicals, and c) risk from radionuclides.
