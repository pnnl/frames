<p>
Surface Water is one component
of the FRAMES system.&nbsp; Of the many types of surface water bodies (e.g.,
nontidal rivers, estuaries, lakes, open coasts, reservoirs, impoundments,
etc.) in which constituent fate and transport could be simulated, only
a nontidal river model is currently incorporated. Nontidal rivers refer
to freshwater bodies with unidirectional flow in definable channels.&nbsp;
Other surface water models can be added when deemed necessary.
<p>The surface water component
provides estimates of constituent concentrations in a river at locations
downstream from a release point.&nbsp; The computed constituent concentrations
are used by the exposure assessment component of FRAMES to calculate dose
and the resulting health effects to the surrounding population.&nbsp; Potential
exposure of humans to constituents via rivers can be associated with ingestion
(e.g., drinking contaminated water), inhalation of volatile pollutants
(e.g., showering), dermal contact to chemicals (e.g., swimming), or external
dose from radionuclides (e.g., swimming).
<p>Because annual-average
constituent releases to a river are relatively long term compared to typical
constituent travel times in a river, the migration and fate of constituents
through the riverine pathway are described by the steady-state, two-dimensional
advective-dispersive equation for solute transport.&nbsp; The results are
based on an analytical solution that is well established in the scientific
literature.&nbsp; The surface water equation accounts for the major mechanisms
of constituent persistence (i.e., degradation/decay), advection, and hydrodynamic
dispersion.&nbsp; Persistence is described by a first-order degradation/decay
coefficient.&nbsp; Radionuclide decay products are also accounted for.&nbsp;
Advection is described by constant unidirectional flow in the longitudinal
direction.&nbsp; Hydrodynamic dispersion is accounted for in the lateral
direction.&nbsp; The processes associated with adsorption/desorption between
the water column and suspended and bed sediments are not addressed.&nbsp;
Neglecting these processes should, in most cases, represent a conservative
assumption with regard to water column constituent concentrations.
<p>Contamination can enter
the riverine environment in one of three ways.&nbsp; The ground water pathway
can supply transient constituent fluxes along the stream bank adjacent
to the aquifer.&nbsp; Overland runoff can supply nonpoint-source constituent
fluxes from the land adjacent to the stream.&nbsp; Finally, the surface
water component of FRAMES allows direct discharges to the stream.
