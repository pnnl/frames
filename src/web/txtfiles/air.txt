The<b> FRAMES</b> atmospheric
component for air media includes models for emission from a source to the
air, initial plume rise and dispersion, airborne pollutant transport and
dispersion, and deposition to soils and crops.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The atmospheric component
uses a series of climatological models for modeling the releases from point
and area sources. In <b>FRAMES</b>, emission estimation models are provided
as an alternative method for cases where the emission rates are unknown
or cannot be back-calculated from environmental monitoring data. <b>FRAMES
</b>has
seven volatilization models for estimating gaseous vapor emissions from
various types of sources and a particle suspension model for estimating
soil-bound pollutant emissions. Plume rise models are included for stack
releases. A sector-average Gaussian model using standard dispersion rates
is used for the atmospheric transport. Both wet and dry deposition are
computed. An important enhancement is that the wind speed, dispersion,
and deposition models account for the influence of local surface roughness.
This feature allows the model to account for local roughness influences
along a wind trajectory ranging from smooth over-water to rough forest
cover. A complex-terrain nocturnal flow option allows for the near-source
channeling of airborne releases.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The major products from
these atmospheric component models include 1) constituent emission rates,
2) regional patterns of long-term air concentrations and deposition rates
normalized by emission rates, 3) near-release short-term acute air concentrations
normalized by emission rates, 4) long-term deposition rates for selected
types of surfaces, and 5) regional patterns of ambient pollutant concentrations.
These output products from the atmospheric component are linked as input
to other components as part of the integrated exposure and impact evaluation
software.
<p>The atmospheric pathway
component estimates the pollutant exposures from atmospheric emissions
to a regional human population. Long-term, average constituent levels are
computed using standard computation techniques for locations defined in
terms of a direction and distance from the site. Using these methods, estimates
of constituent levels for exposure assessment can be made for both population
centers and less populated rural areas. Short-term normalized air concentrations
are provided for evaluation of acute exposures at nearby locations.
