<h2>Module Description File (DES)</h2>
The DES file is the mechanism that informs the FUI the who, what, where, and how to integrate and run a module.
<p>
The following outline is a description of the basic information provided in the DES. An example DES file is included after the outline. Comparing the line by line description in the outline to the example should clarify and help locate data contained in the WFF file. Lines beginning with ';' are descriptive comments only and will not appear in the actual DES.

MODULE VERSION
4.1

MODULE DESCRIPTION
MEPAS 4.1 Chronic Exposure Module

The MEPAS Chronic Exposure Module can be used to
calculate pollutant concentrations in exposure
media resulting from contamination of air,
groundwater, surface water, and soil. The module
includes consideration of domestic water use,
farm product consumption, aquatic food consumption,
surface water recreational activities, soil contact
exposure, and air exposures.  Both chemical and
radioactive pollutants may be evaluated.  Indoor
air inhalation of volatile compounds may be evaluated
using either the MEPAS shower model or the
EPA/Andelman indoor air model.  Transfer of activity
through food chains is modeled using concentration
ratios, bioaccumulation factors and transfer factors.
Radioactive chain decay with branching is included
in evaluation of changing media concentrations with
time.  Buildup and leaching of constituents from
surface soil is accounted for as a function of time.
For waterborne contamination, exposure media
concentrations are evaluated for one location.
For atmospheric contamination, media concentrations
are evaluated For each location defined in the ato file.

Limitations:
  The atmospheric transport output file (ato) can have
  data for a maximum of 10 time periods, 20 distances,
  and 36 directions.  A maximum of 100 time points can
  be defined For each data set in the water concentration
  file (wcf).
