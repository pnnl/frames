  <h2>Environmental Decay Half Times</h2><p>
<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>Four environmental half times can be specified in the
database, each for describing losses from specific media: groundwater, surface
water, soil, and air. The environmental half time represents the time for the
amount of a pollutant to be reduced by one half in the specific medium. Various
processes may be responsible for the loss, depending on the chemical and medium.
Values for environmental half time in the database are generally set to a large
default value (9 x 10^9 days) when pollutant specific information is not
available in the literature. For the medium soil, loss rate constants for
volatile chemicals have been estimated using a volatilization model for old
spills to provide a conservative (slow release) estimate of volatilization
losses. A similar analysis has been made to estimate the environmental half time
for volatile chemicals in surface waters. Environmental half times for
groundwater and air are generally set to the default maximum value representing
no losses. All values for radionuclides are set to the radiological half-life
for the radionuclide. <BR><BR>
