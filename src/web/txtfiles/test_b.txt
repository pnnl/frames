<b><font size=+1>General Instructions For Setting
Up And Running Test Cases</b></font>
<p>
	This section describes how to set up and run cases using FRAMES (Framework for Risk Analysis in Multimedia Environmental Systems) software system. These instructions assume FRAMES user interface is running and visible on user’s computer.
<p>
	Each test case must include a minimum of three modules: a constituent database, FRAMES Known constituent Flux or Concentrations source term model, and a transport or exposure model. Additional modules can be added to process data further or to view output results files, but these additional modules are not necessarily required for test case execution. A brief description of icons associated with each module is listed in <a href="test_a.html">Appendix A.</a>
<p>
	To start a new case, select New from File menu.  Enter a file name and select Open.  Enter a site name at prompt.  Double-click on constituent icon on toolbar. icon should appear in workspace section of screen along with a signal light will be completely black. black signal light indicates a constituent database and constituents have not been selected. Once database and constituents are selected, light will turn green indicating module has been given necessary data and executed.
<p>
Right click constituents icon and choose ‘General Info’ from popup menu. A window titled ‘Object General Information’ will appear. section titled ‘Select from Applicable Models’ contains a list of databases can be used in FRAMES system. Click on ‘FRAMES Default Chemical Database Selection’. A description will appear in ‘Model Description’ section to right. Click ‘Ok’ at bottom of screen. Next, right click constituents icon and click ‘User Input’ from popup menu.  A new window titled ‘FRAMES Constituent Database Editor’ will appear. constituents of interest must be chosen using this screen. list of constituents can be sorted and filtered into several categories. default category is ‘All constituents’. Other categories may be chosen from list box near top of window. constituents selected for all test cases were chosen from ‘All constituents’ list.
<p>
	To select a constituent, type name of constituent in ‘Search for:’ box. Click ‘Find Next’. first constituent containing constituent name will be highlighted in list to right. For example, if you type in ‘benzene’ then ‘1,2 Dichlorobenzene’ will be highlighted because contains string ‘benzene’. Since ‘1,2 Dichlorobenzene’ is not constituent of interest for this example, click on ‘Find Next’ and next constituent containing ‘benzene’ will be highlighted. Continue to click ‘Find Next’ until plain ‘Benzene’ is highlighted. Click on ‘Add >>>’ to insert ‘Benzene’ into list of constituents will be used. Additional constituents can be added by following same process. A constituent may be removed from list by highlighting constituent in list to right and clicking ‘<<< Remove’. When the list is complete click ‘OK’. The constituent selection screen will disappear and the signal light attached to the constituents icon will turn green, indicating that constituent selection is complete.
<p>
	The next step is to set up a Source Term module. To do this, double-click on Source icon in toolbar. A Source Term icon will appear at top-left corner of workspace. Drag Source Term icon to location in workspace you desire. source term icon will appear with a black signal light. black signal light indicates a Source Term model has not been chosen. Once source term model has been selected, signal light will turn red indicating a model has been selected. When required data has been entered, light will turn yellow indicating model has been completed and is ready to be executed. Before work can begin on setting up source term, a connection must be made from constituents icon to Source Term icon. To do this, hold down shift button on keyboard, click and hold mouse button over constituents icon, drag cursor until is over Source Term icon, release mouse button, and finally release shift button. A line with arrow pointing from constituents icon to Source Term icon should appear.
<p>
	Once connection has been made, right click on Source Term icon and click ‘General Info’ from menu appears. A window titled ‘Object General Information’ should appear. In box titled ‘Label’ type in a source model name. Then select a source term model from list in ‘Select from Applicable Models’ box on left. All tests in this document were performed using ‘FRAMES Known constituent Flux or Concentrations’ source term model. Note lower left text box lists <i>non</i>-applicable models for current module type and also a brief model description appears in text box to right. Highlight ‘FRAMES Known Source Module’ source term model and click ‘Ok’ at bottom of screen. ‘Object General Information’ screen will disappear. Notice signal light has changed to red, indicating a source term model has been chosen.
<p>
	Next, double-click Vadose Zone on toolbar and move Vadose Zone icon appears to location desired. Create a connection from Source Term icon to Vadose Zone icon using same method as described previously. connection can be removed by repeating same process. Note arrow indicating direction of data transfer. After icons have been connected, select a Vadose Zone model using same procedure used to select Source Term model. ‘MEPAS 4.1 Vadose Zone Module’ should be selected for all test cases involving Vadose Zone. Notice signal light should turn red, indicating Vadose Zone model has been selected.
<p>
	After Vadose Zone and Source Term modules have been connected, input data can be entered in Source Term module. Right click on Source Term icon and select ‘User Input’. user interface for model should appear. At this time, enter all of required data. When all of required input data has been entered, use ‘File’ pull-down menu to select ‘Save and Exit’. If any of required data was not entered, error message box will appear and signal light will remain red. If this happens, right click on source term icon, and select ‘User Input’. user interface for source term module will reappear. All fields containing invalid values will be highlighted in red. Type in acceptable value in each of these fields and save and exit again. Upon exiting, signal light will turn yellow, indicating Source Term module can be executed. Right click on Source Term icon and select ‘Run Model’. model will run and signal light will turn green, indicating model run succeeded.
<p>
	The results may be found in output file with WFF extension. results can also be viewed in FRAMES by using one of viewers. To use a viewer, right-click on module icon and select desired viewer from sub-menu of context menu item View/Print Module Output.  Close window when you are finished with . You can activate viewers for all other modules by repeating this process and selecting a viewer type appropriate to particular file being displayed. Alternatively, output files can be viewed using DOS, M.S. Excel, Notepad, or other similar programs. It is important to note viewers will only run when the module they are attached to has a green light because viewers require complete files to display.
<p>
	The above process describes methods used to add modules, choose constituents, choose models, connect modules, enter input data, run models, and view results. These same techniques will be used to set up specific modeling scenarios in this test plan.
