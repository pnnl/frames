<h2>Test Case 3 </h2><p>

<b> Description and Rationale </b><p>





            This case verifies that the FRAMES User Interface (FUI) provides working viewers that can be used to view all module output files that meet the FRAMES specifications. Note that the FUI chart viewers require Microsoft Excel to be installed on the system. The file ‘fui_02.gid’ will be opened and edited. This is the Global Input Data (GID) file created in Test Case FUI_02.

<b> Instructions for Performing the Test and Expected Results </b><p>



            These instructions assume that the FUI is running and visible on the user’s screen. From the ‘File’ menu, select ‘Open’. When prompted which file to open, select the GID file named ‘fui_02.gid’. The scenario developed in Test Case 2 should appear in the working space. Save the file as ‘fui_03.gid’. To do this, select ‘Save As’ from the ‘File’ menu. When prompted for a new file name, type in ‘fui_03.gid’ and click on the ‘Save’ button. Notice that the file name in the lower left corner changed to ‘fui_03.gid’ and also that all of the module signal lights (excluding the constituent selection module) have turned yellow. This happens because when a case is ‘Saved As’ only the User Input data is saved. The intermediate and output results from the original file are not copied. The yellow lights indicate that the models need to be run again. To do this quickly, click on the ‘GO’ button. All modules should execute automatically and all signal lights should turn green.<p>


            All viewers for which there is a description file (DES) are only accessible from the popup context menu on a right-click of a module’s icon.  All output files will be checked to ensure that they can be viewed. Most will be viewed both as text and graphically, but some can only be viewed as text. <p>



            The first step will ensure that the FUI viewers work for the Air Flux File (AFF).  These viewers will be used to view the contents of the Air Flux File (AFF) both graphically and as text. Right click on the Source Term icon, move the cursor to View/Print Module Output and click on AFF Text View.  The contents of the file ‘fui_03.aff’ should appear. Close the window. Next, right click on the Source Term icon, move the cursor to View/Print Module Output and click on AFF Graphical View. The FUI chart viewer starts Microsoft Excel and then charts the contents of the AFF file. Close Excel without saving.<p>



            This process will be repeated to ensure that the FUI viewers also work for the Water Flux File (WFF). These viewers will be used to view the contents of the WFF both graphically and as text.  Right click on the Saturated Zone icon, move the cursor to View/Print Module Output and click on WFF Text View.  The contents of the file ‘fui_03.wff’ should appear. Close the window. Next, right click on the Saturated Zone icon, move the cursor to View/Print Module Output and click on WFF Graphical View. The FUI chart viewer starts Microsoft Excel and then charts the contents of the WFF file. Close Excel without saving.<p>



            This process will be repeated again to verify that the FUI viewer works for the Atmospheric Output (ATO) file as well. This viewer will be used to view the contents of the ATO as text. There is no FUI ATO chart viewer. Right click on the icon labeled Air, move the cursor to View/Print Module Output and click on ATO Text View. The contents of the file ‘fui_03.ato’ should appear. Close the window.<p>



            This process will yet again be repeated to confirm that the FUI viewers work for the Water Concentration File (WCF) also. These viewers will be used to view the contents of the WCF both graphically and as text. Right click on the icon labeled Surface Water, move the cursor to View/Print Module Output and click on WCF Text View. The contents of the file ‘fui_03.wcf’ should appear. Close the window. Next, right click again on the icon labeled Surface Water, move the cursor to View/Print Module Output and click on WFF Graphical View. The FUI chart viewer launches Microsoft Excel and charts the contents of the WCF file. Close Excel without saving.<p>

            This process will be repeated to ensure that the FUI viewers work for the Exposure Pathway File (EPF). These viewers will be used to view the contents of the EPF both graphically and as text. Right click on the icon labeled Exposure, move the cursor to View/Print Module Output and click on EPF Text View. The contents of the file ‘fui_03.epf’ should appear. Close the window. [Error in xlschart.exe epf]<p>



            Again, the process will be repeated, this time to verify that the FUI viewer works for the Receptor Intake File (RIF). These viewers will be used to view the contents of the RIF both graphically and as text. Right click on the Receptor Pathways icon , move the cursor to View/Print Module Output and click on RIF Text View. The contents of the file ‘fui_03.rif’ should appear. Close the window. [xlschart.exe rif]<p>



            The process will be repeated one last time to check whether or not the FUI viewer works for the Health Impacts File (HIF). These viewers will be used to view the contents of the HIF both graphically and as text. Right click on the Health Impacts icon, move the cursor to View/Print Module Output and click on HIF Text View. The contents of the file ‘fui_03.hif’ should appear. Close the window. Next, right click on the Health Impacts icon , move the cursor to View/Print Module Output and click on HIF Graphical View. This FUI chart viewer runs a separate viewer program. Select any combination of options and click ‘Excel chart’ to launch Microsoft Excel and chart the data. Close Excel without saving.  There are several other viewers for the HIF file that are addressed in FRAMES Viewers documentation.<p>



            This test ensures that the FUI can view all types of FRAMES output files either as text or graphically, or both, is now completed. An additional viewer is available to view Sensitivity Uncertainty Files (SUF). Case 9 will test it.<p>



            Close this case and save the changes.<p>
