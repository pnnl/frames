		   <p><b><h1>Glossary</h1></center>

		   <p>The following terms, which are listed in alphabetical
		   order, are used in this document in ways that may not be familiar to some
		   readers.
		   <p><b>Baseline</b>—a system or module that has been designed,
		   developed, and initially tested to meet a particular need, either internal
		   to the Laboratory or for a client
		   <p><b>Change request</b>—a written request (or a verbal request
		   written down) by a client or other user of an environmental software system
		   to modify that system. Changes can include enhancements or revisions to
		   solve identified problems. Each change is tracked separately.
		   <p><b>Change request summary</b>—summary of all activities
		   related to a particular change in a module or system. The summary is completed
		   by the project custodian.
		   <p><b>Code</b>—information provided to guide a computer system
		   through a particular process. Both modules and frameworks depend on code
		   to function properly.
		   <p><b>Component</b>—a piece of a software system, for example,
		   module, module user interface, model, pre/post-processor, or framework
		   user interface.
		   <p><b>Design</b>—the process of determining appropriate ways
		   of meeting client and user requirements
		   <p><b>Development</b>—the process of implementing a design
		   <p><b>Environmental software system</b>—a set of modules
		   with a framework designed to analyze risk to human health or the environment
		   through multiple environmental media
		   <p><b>Error/bug</b>—a difficulty encountered by the user
		   when applying the software system that hinders the application for which
		   the system was intended
		   <p><b>Framework</b>—mechanism for holistically linking a
		   variety of models while ensuring compatible input and outputs and maintaining
		   the development of testing legacy of individual components
		   <p><b>Input</b>—data, information, or code that is needed
		   by a module to function
		   <p><b>Implementation</b>—the act of transferring a set of
		   modules within a framework to a client for application at their organization
		   <p><b>Model</b>— the set of scientific calculations that
		   define a particular module
		   <p><b>Modification</b>—a change to or the process of changing
		   a baselined module or framework. Modifications can be enhancements or revisions
		   to fix a particular problem such as an error or bug.
		   <p><b>Module</b>—a user interface, scientific model, and
		   possible pre/post-processors that together provide a tool for analyzing
		   environmental phenomena, these modules may be related to a particular environmental
		   media (water, air, soil, etc.), health risk based, statistically based,
		   or any other set of scientific formulations used to model the environment.
		   <p><b>Module user interface</b>—the computer screens that
		   make it easy to collect the data necessary to run the model. Besides gathering
		   the necessary data, the user interface often provides online help to the
		   user, reference storage options for collected data, flexible unit inputs,
		   and other user support functions.
		   <p><b>Multiple media</b>—potential portions of the environment
		   through which a human, animal, or plant might be exposed to contamination
		   (for example, water, air, soil, etc.)
		   <p><b>Object-oriented</b>—the practice of breaking down a
		   system into its unique and logical components, then developing those components
		   only once and applying them to the system. Each individual components purpose
		   is well defined and testable.
		   <p><b>Output</b>—data, information, or code that results
		   from a module functioning
		   <p><b>Package</b>—the information, documentation, print outs,
		   diagrams, and/or electronic files that document the activities conducted
		   under a particular project or task for a particular stage in the software
		   development life cycle (requirements package for requirements analysis,
		   software development package for design and development, software test
		   package for testing, user’s guidance and training package for implementation,
		   and change package for modifying baselined systems or modules).
		   <p><b>Pre/post-processor</b>—additional code necessary to
		   reconcile module input/output with output/input needs from other the system
		   framework.
		   <p><b>Project management plan</b>—description of the ways
		   in which an activity will be conducted to meet client needs
		   <p><b>Project Team </b>—the various staff assigned to develop
		   a system or module to meet client needs
		   <p><b>Requirements</b>—objectives, activities, constraints,
		   and other information that specify what the client needs the new system
		   or module to accomplish
		   <p><b>Requirements package</b>--the information, documentation,
		   print outs, diagrams, and/or electronic files that document the objectives,
		   activities, constraints, and other information that specify what the client
		   needs the new system or module to accomplish and how the client will use
		   the system
		   <p><b>Software development package</b>--the information,
		   documentation, print outs, diagrams, and/or electronic files that document
		   the methods by which client requirements will be met
		   <p><b>Software test package</b>-- the information, documentation,
		   print outs, diagrams, and/or electronic files that document the how the
		   system, module, or change will be tested to ensure that it meets client
		   requirements
		   <p><b>Statement of work</b>—description of activities to
		   be accomplished for a particular client and the methods by which they will
		   be accomplished
		   <p><b>Technology transfer</b>—the process of providing the
		   systems or modules to the client’s organization for use by their staff
		   <p><b>Testing</b>—the process of checking that systems or
		   modules meet the client requirements and function within the necessary
		   settings
		   <p><b>User</b>—the person who will use the system or module
to estimate risks to human health or the environment
