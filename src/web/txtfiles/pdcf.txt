 <h2>Specifications</h2><p>

All Specifications, also known as Primary Data Communication
Files (PDCF), will have similar structural components but different
specific content. The PDCF that any individual module generates is integrated
into a `global' PDCF containing all like (PDCF) data from other modules.
To make the reading of the PDCF more efficient, markers are used to identify
the unique dataset for a particular module. A marker consists of the module
name and the number of lines in the subsequent dataset. These markers must
be accounted for when reading the global PDCF but are not included in a
module's output PDCF. Embedding markers and line counts is the function
of the PDCF integration process only. Each module's dataset will have a
heading area and data area. The content of the heading area is defined
by each module/code developer and gives general information on the code
and analysis represented by the current file. Information included here
would be variable (or nothing); however, as a minimum, the following is
recommended.<p>


<blockquote>Identification of the module/code
used to generate the file
<p>Identification of the analyst responsible
for generation of the file
<p>Date of file generation and last modification
<p>Description of the situation being modeled
by the data in the file
<p>Descriptive information giving basic assumptions
of the analysis, with key differences between related analyses.</blockquote>
The first line of a dataset will contain a
numerical value (integer) indicating the number of lines that follow devoted
to the heading information. The second part of the file starts after the
end of the heading information.
<p>The extension is used to distinguish what
information is contained in the file.
<p>FRAMES organizes the PDCF into two types: System and Module.  The PDCFs currently incorporated in FRAMES are listed below.  Click on each to view a description and example.
