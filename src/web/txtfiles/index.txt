<h2>FRAMES</h2>
<p><b>FRAMES</b> (Framework for Risk Analysis Multimedia Environmental Systems)&nbsp;is a software platform developed by PNNL for selecting and implementing
environmental software models for risk assessment and management problems.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>This program is a
flexible and holistic approach to understanding how industrial activities
affect humans and the environment. It incorporates models that integrate
across scientific disciplines, allowing for tailored solutions to specific
activities, and it provides meaningful information to business and technical
managers. FRAMES is the key to identifying, analyzing, and managing potential
Environmental, Safety, and Health risks.</font></font></font>

OF FRAMES</font></font></font></u>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>&nbsp;The purpose
of FRAMES is to assist users in developing environmental scenarios and
to provide options for selecting the most appropriate computer codes to conduct
human and environmental risk management analyses.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>FRAMES accomplishes
this purpose by:</font></font></font></b>
<ul>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>Allowing users
to link codes under one integrated system using standard data file specifications</font></font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>Building a conceptual
site model (CSM) using module icons in a Windows<sup>TM</sup>-based interface in
order to represent flow of contamination through environment</font></font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>Conducting sensitivity
and uncertainty analyses on assessments</font></font></font></li>

<p><u><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=+1>WHY FRAMES?</font></font></font></u>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>&nbsp;FRAMES
exhibits four unique attributes that are unparalleled by any other environmental
operations and assessment modeling tools produced today.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>&nbsp;<b><u>USER-FRIENDLY</u></b></font></font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>FRAMES
provides the capability to conceptualize environmental issues using an
intuitive drag-and-drop system of icons to construct a pictorial display.
FRAMES also employs user-friendly interfaces for easy data entry and model
selection. All of FRAMES user interfaces have on-line help associated with
them to provide users with information at their fingertips.</font></font></font></blockquote>

<p><br><b><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>&nbsp;<u>FLEXIBILITY</u></font></font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>FRAMES
is designed to allow independently developed codes to be fully integrated.
FRAMES can accommodate codes written in different programming languages.
Once a code is fully integrated into FRAMES, it functions with other
integrated codes and the FRAMES sensitivity uncertainty module. With FRAMES,
users can develop a personalized modeling system with preferred and/or
required codes.</font></font></font></blockquote>

<p><br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>&nbsp;<b><u>COMPREHENSIVE</u></b></font></font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>FRAMES
allows users to model constituent movement from its original source,
through the environment, and to the environmental or human receptors.  Then it provides
their associated health impacts. This type of holistic approach is critical
to assessing highly interactive and interrelated issues associated with
Environmental, Safety, and Health risks.&nbsp;</font></font></font></blockquote>

<p><br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>FRAMES
also allows users to view modeling information through text, table,
and graphical views to confirm and verify information. In addition,
FRAMES provides a method of determining which modeling parameters impact
results the most and levels of uncertainty involved in results
based on these parameters. This analysis gives managers a critical piece
of information missing in many such assessments--what can be changed to
lessen the environmental impacts. FRAMES is a fully documented software platform
and has been co-funded by DOE, EPA, DOD, and Battelle.</font></font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>&nbsp;<b><u>APPLICATION-ORIENTED</u></b></font></font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>This software
platform was developed with problem-solving in mind and is application-orientated.
FRAMES combines the best of both government and industrial technical knowledge
and expertise, and it has been independently reviewed for technicality and
usability. </font></font></font>
