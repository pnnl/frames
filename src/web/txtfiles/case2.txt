<h2>Testing:
Case 2&nbsp;</h2>
<p><b><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>Description
and Rationale&nbsp;</font></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>This case verifies
that the Frames User Interface (FUI) allows the user to open an existing Global Input Data
(GID) file, edit and save the file under a different name, and delete an
icon. The ‘GO’ button, which allows the user to run all modules with a
yellow or green light by pressing a single button, will also be tested.
The file that will be opened and edited is ‘fui_01.gid’. This is the GID
file that was created in Test Case FUI_01.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>Instructions
for Performing the Test and Expected Results&nbsp;</font></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>These instructions
assume that the FUI is running and visible on the user’s screen. Select
‘Open’ from the ‘File’ menu. You will be prompted to select a GID file
to open. Select the GID file ‘fui_01.gid’. The scenario developed in Test
Case 1 should appear in the working space. Save the file as ‘fui_02.gid’
by selecting ‘Save As’ from the ‘File’ menu.<p> When prompted, type in ‘fui_02.gid’
as the new file name and click on the ‘Save’ button. Notice that the file
name in the lower left corner changed to ‘fui_02.gid’ and also that all
of the module signal lights (excluding the constituent selection module)
have turned yellow.<p> This happens because when a case is ‘Saved As’ only
the User Input data is saved. The intermediate and output results from
the original file are not copied. The yellow lights indicate that the models
need to be run again. To do this quickly, click on the ‘GO’ button. All
modules should execute automatically and all signal lights should turn
green.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Next,
delete the Vadose Zone icon by right clicking on the Vadose Zone module
and selecting ‘Delete’ from the popup menu. A message window will appear
to ask you if you are sure you want to delete the module. Click ‘Yes’ and
the Vadose Zone icon will be deleted. Note that all of the signal lights
will turn red because the modeling scenario has been changed. Connect the
Source Term icon directly to the Saturated Zone icon (Source Term _ Saturated
Zone). Then choose the ‘MEPAS® 4.1 Saturated Zone Module’ as the model for
the Saturated Zone.<p> Re-run the scenario using the ‘GO’ button again. The
modules in this scenario need to be advanced to the yellow light stage.
Therefore, when you click the ‘GO’ button, each model user interface will
appear. All of the data entered in Test Case 1 has been preserved, so leave
all settings as they are. Use the ‘File’ drag down menu to save and exit
each user interface. After all of the model user interfaces have been brought
up and saved, the FUI should run the scenario to completion. Again, all
signal lights should turn to green.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000080"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Close
the file and save the changes.</font></font></font>
