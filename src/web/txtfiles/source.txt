The <b>FRAMES</b> source-term
release module includes models for estimating constituent loss from three
different types of source zones: contaminated aquifer, contaminated pond/surface
impoundment, and contaminated vadose zone. In all types of constituent
source zones, it is assumed that the constituents may be present in multiple
phases (i.e., in aqueous solution, sorbed to solid particles, in vapor-filled
pore space, or in a separate non-aqueous-phase liquid [NAPL] that is immiscible
with water and air). The source-term release module contains models to
determine which constituents in the problem scenario will partition into
which phases, and to what degree. Depending on the type of source zone,
it is assumed that the processes causing constituent release from the source
zone to an environmental transport pathway could be leaching (groundwater
pathway), wind suspension (atmospheric pathway), water erosion (overland/surface
water pathway), overland flow (overland/surface water pathway), and/or
volatilization (atmospheric pathway). In addition, constituents could be
lost from the source zone by radioactive decay or degradation within the
zone. The source-term release module contains models for simulating "baseline"
(i.e., unremediated) scenarios for all three types of source zones. These
same models can be used to simulate remediated sites (for all three types
of source zones) if the remediation methodology can be represented merely
by changing the magnitude of certain model parameters from their "baseline"
values. In addition, for the vadose zone source zone, the source-term release
module contains models that can calculate loss fluxes from vadose zones
subjected to two types of remediation methodologies that require special
theory: in situ vitrification (ISV) and in situ
solidification (ISS).
<p> The ultimate objective of the
source-term release component is to calculate a "mass-budgeted" set of
constituent flux versus time functions that describe the simultaneous loss
of constituents from the source zone to a number of different routes. When
multiple loss processes are assumed to occur simultaneously, the mathematical
models implemented in the source-term release module account for their
synergistic or antagonistic interaction. "Mass-budgeted" means that the
inventory of each constituent is apportioned to each loss route (by the
implemented physics-based theory) in a manner such that the sum of the
calculated constituent losses to all routes is limited to 100% of the initial
inventory. The source-term release module has been developed to allow the
user flexibility in how the constituent release to different routes is
simulated. If the user wishes to explicitly enter the constituent flux
to one or more loss routes (based on known or assumed data, or the predictions
of some other model), the source-term release component will use the supplied
flux versus time function(s) until mass balance considerations dictate
that the flux must go to zero (because cumulative constituent mass loss
to all routes has removed 100% of the initial inventory). If the user cannot
or does not wish to supply explicit constituent fluxes to any or all loss
routes, the source-term release component contains models that will calculate
the flux verses time functions (also according to mass balance considerations).
If the user wants to analyze a scenario that assumes constituent release
to only a subset of the possible loss routes for a given type of source
zone, loss to undesired routes can be "turned off" by specifying a known
flux of zero to those routes.
