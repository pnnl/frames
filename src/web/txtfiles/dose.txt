  <h2>Dose Factors</h2><p>

<b>Radiation Dosimetry Factors:</b>
<P>Two methods are in general use for evaluation of risk from intake of
radionuclides. The first involves use of radiation dosimetry factors to estimate
the lifetime radiation dose from the postulated exposure scenario. The total
lifetime radiation dose is then multiplied by a health effects conversion factor
to obtain the human health risk endpoint (usually cancer incidence or cancer
fatality risk). The second method for estimation of radiation risk involves use
of slope factors provided by the EPA Health Effect Assessment Summary Tables
(HEAST). Slope factors are provided for inhalation and ingestion intake routes,
and for external exposure to radionuclides distributed uniformly in contaminated
soil. The slope factors and radiation dosimetry factors are contained in the
MEPAS database. The radiation dose factors are based on EPA Federal Guidance
Reports (FGR) 11 and 12. The dermal absorption dose factors have been calculated
by staff of Pacific Northwest Laboratory, using a dosimetric computer program
similar to the program used to generate the internal dosimetry numbers of FGR
11.</P>
<P>The following table indicates the exposure pathways that may be evaluated
using the slope factors and radiation dose factors. </P><PRE>

<P>A summary of the radiation dosimetry and slope factors follows for the
parameters included in the MEPAS database.</P>
<b>Inhalation Dose Factor (rem/pCi):</b>
<p>
The inhalation dose factor gives the
lifetime radiation dose (effective dose equivalent) from inhalation of unit
activity (one pCi) of a radionuclide. The dose factors include contributions
from radiation decay chain progeny produced within the body after inhalation of
the parent radionuclide.
<p>
<b>Ingestion Dose Factor (rem/pCi):</b>
<p>
The ingestion dose factor gives the
lifetime radiation dose (effective dose equivalent) from ingestion of unit
activity (one pCi) of a radionuclide. The dose factors include contributions
from radiation decay chain progeny produced within the body after ingestion of
the parent radionuclide.
<p>
<b>Dermal Absorption Dose Factor (rem/pCi):</b>
<p>
The dermal absorption dose
factor gives the lifetime radiation dose (effective dose equivalent) following
dermal absorption of unit activity (one pCi) of a radionuclide. The dose factors
include contributions from radiation decay chain progeny produced within the
body after absorption of the parent radionuclide. The dermal absorption dose
factor is applied to the estimated total absorption of the radionuclide through
the skin for dermal contact (water or soil) scenarios.
<p>
<b>External Radiation Dose Factor for Submersion in Contaminated Air (rem/hr
per pCi/m^3):</b>
<p>
The air submersion external dose factor provides the dose rate
for exposure to a radionuclide distributed uniformly in air. This exposure
pathway is generally not significant compared to the inhalation pathway, except
for noble gas radionuclides (i.e. krypton-85) which are not absorbed by the body
during inhalation.
<p>
<b>External Radiation Dose Factor for Exposure to Contaminated Soil (rem/hr per
pCi/m^2):</b>
<p>
The ground external dose factor provides the dose rate for
exposure to a radionuclide from a radionuclide distributed uniformly in soil.
The radionuclide is assumed to be in an infinite contaminated soil layer,
although for practical purposes, a contamination depth of 1 meter represents an
effective infinite layer (i.e., increasing the depth of contamination below 1
meter will not increase the dose rate).
<p>
<b>External Radiation Dose Factor for Exposure to Contaminated Water (rem/hr
per pCi/L):</b>
<p>
The water immersion external dose factor provides the dose rate
for exposure to a radionuclide while immersed in contaminated water. The dose
factor is used to estimate the external dose while swimming and boating (partial
immersion).
<p>
<b>Inhalation Slope Factor (risk/pCi):</b>
<p>
The inhalation slope factor provides
an estimate of the risk of cancer (incidence) from inhalation of a radionuclide.
All slope factors in the MEPAS database were taken from HEAST reports. Values
are subject to change as new HEAST reports are issued by EPA.
<p>
<b>Ingestion Slope Factor (risk/pCi):</b>
<p>
The ingestion slope factor provides
an estimate of the risk of cancer (incidence) from ingestion of a radionuclide.
All slope factors in the MEPAS database were taken from HEAST reports. Values
are subject to change as new HEAST reports are issued by EPA.
<p>
<b>External Exposure to Soil Slope Factor (risk/yr per pCi/kg):</b>
<p>
The
external exposure slope factor provides an estimate of risk per year of exposure
from exposure to radionuclides in soil. All external slope factors in the MEPAS
database are taken from HEAST reports. Values are subject to change as new HEAST
reports are issued by EPA.<BR><BR>
