<h2>Human Health Impacts</h2>
<p>
Health impact models are used
to estimate the health impacts from exposure to the pollutant of concern.
Models are defined for noncarcinogenic chemicals, carcinogenic chemicals,
and radionuclides and radiation dose. When populations are exposed to carcinogenic
pollutants, including radiation, estimates of health impacts to an exposed
population may also be made by multiplication of the effect to an average
member of the population by the number of people in the exposed population.
<p>Human health impacts are
estimated from the average daily dose provided by the exposure pathway
models.&nbsp; Impacts from radiation exposure (radionuclides and measured
direct radiation), carcinogenic chemicals, and noncarcinogenic chemicals
are estimated.&nbsp; Health impact assessments for exposure of an individual
or an average member of the population are estimated.
<p>Health impacts from exposure
to radiation and radionuclides are expressed as the risk of developing
cancer. This risk may be reported as the lifetime risk of total cancer
incidence or as cancer fatalities. Two methods are available to estimate
the risk of cancer fatalities: use of health- effects conversion factors
and use of USEPA slope factors.
<p>The lifetime risk of total
cancer incidence is estimated using USEPA slope factors for chemical carcinogens
for inhalation and ingestion exposure pathways. Dermal exposures are evaluated
as equivalent ingestion intakes as described in the sections on dermal
absorption pathways. The USEPA slope factors give the lifetime cancer incidence
risk per average daily dose.
<p>The health impacts for
exposure to noncarcinogenic chemicals are expressed as a hazard quotient.
The hazard quotient is the ratio of the average daily dose to the reference
dose. The reference dose is defined by the USEPA for many chemicals for
ingestion and inhalation intakes (USEPA 1993). The reference dose represents
a level that is believed to be safe for members of the general population.
Exposure at this level will result in a hazard quotient of 1.0.
<p>Health impacts from exposure
to carcinogenic chemicals and radionuclides can be estimated for the entire
exposed population. For these pollutants, the population health impacts
are assumed to be proportional to the exposure level. This allows a population
health impact to be evaluated as the product of the lifetime risk to the
average member of the population times the number of people in the population.
