			<p><a NAME="summary"></a><b>SUMMARY</b>

			<p>The environmental software systems developed under this
			approach are often used to determine impacts to the public, workers, and
			the environment from environmental contamination. The resulting information
			from systems is used in the context of important environmental decision
			making. It is vital, therefore, that the modeling results and the systems
			that provide them be scientifically defensible and capable of withstanding
			the most rigorous of technical reviews. In other words, the control and
			assurance of quality is a critical factor for environmental software
			systems project team (project team) in the development of environmental
			software systems.

			<p>This document describes the philosophy, process and activities that 
			ensure a quality product throughout the life cycle of the development,
			modification, testing, and implementation of environmental software systems
			to analyze risk in multiple environmental media. Quality is defined as the 
			ability of a system to meet the client's needs. Meeting client needs starts
			with a shared understanding of how the software must perform. It continues
			throughout the software life cycle through attention to details.

			<p>The environmental software systems developed by the project
			team are designed using an object-oriented approach. These systems offer
			increased benefits over those of the traditional "hard wired" systems, such
			as the ease of maintenance and the retention of development and testing legacy
			of individual components, which makes the design and testing of models
			and future additions faster and less costly. These systems are developed
			using a modular framework concept thtat allows users the flexibility to
			construct, combine, and couple attributes to meet their specific needs.
			This framework concept allows a variety of models to work within a single
			construct.

			<p>There are two parts to these software systems: an overall
			system framework and a set of modules. Each module has three components:
			a user interface, a scientific model, and pre/post-processors. Each of
			these pieces has a different set of quality criteria associated with it.
			However, whatever form these software systems might take for a particular
			client, standard processes apply to protect information from inappropriate
			use. These processes include application security, installation security,
			and protection of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.

			<p>The performance metrics for these software systems are
			grouped into eight categories: compatibility, completeness, consistency,
			correctness, ability to be modified, robustness, understandability, and
			testability. Many of the metrics in these categories are generally met
			in our standard approach of object-oriented design.

			<p>Figure S.1 outlines the environmental software system
			development process with quality check points highlighted. Although many
			existing models have been developed for U.S. Department of Energy,
			those systems may also be applicable to other agencies or organizations.
			Because many of our systems are designed for U.S. Environmental Protection
			Agency, or to be compatible with their systems, our quality process was
			designed to be compatible with their EPA Directive 2182, <i>System Design
			and Development Guidance</i> (EPA 1997). Activities roughly equivalent
			to their Essential Elements of Information are shown in Table S.1.

			<p>The information contained within this document can be
			applied to most environmental software systems developed by the project
			team to analyze risk in multiple environmental media, although in some
			cases, client needs will require an even greater level of assurance. For
			specific projects, clients should refer to the proposal, statement of work,
			and/or the project management plan for additional information on detailed
			quality requirements and activities being planned.

			<p><a NAME="intro"></a><b>1.0 INTRODUCTION</b>

			<p>A variety of environmental management regulations today
			require use of computer models of varying sophistication for estimating
			impacts of activities on humans and environment. One example is
			environmental remediation and restoration activities under Comprehensive
			Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) or Superfund.
			Another is development, implementation, and enforcement of regulations
			concerned with protecting human and ecological health from chemical and
			nonchemical human-induced contamination. These types of regulations have
			led to a rapidly growing need for risk analysis software systems that take
			a holistic approach to evaluating human health and ecological risks and
			hazards. Such systems assess impacts from a more comprehensive environmental
			systems perspective, cross-cutting various scientific disciplines. They
			also consider an increased number of interactions between constituents,
			environmental media, and receptors (Whelan et al. 1997).

			<p>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (Laboratory),
			operated by Battelle for U.S. Department of Energy, has been in
			forefront of developing such systems for clients span federal agencies,
			industry, and academia. project team’s software systems are often used
			to determine impacts to public, workers, and environment from environmental
			contamination. resulting information from system is used in
			context of important environmental decision making, affecting not only
			regulatory agencies and potentially responsible parties, but decision
			stakeholders as well. It is vital, therefore, that the modeling results,
			and the systems that provide them be scientifically defensible and capable
			of withstanding most rigorous of technical reviews. In other words,
			the control and assurance of quality is a critical factor of the project
			team in development of software systems to analyze risk in multiple
			environmental media.

	<p><a NAME="1_1"></a><b>1.1 Purpose of This Document</b>

			<p>This document describes the philosophy, process, and activities
			that ensure a quality product in the development, modification, testing,
			and implementation of software to analyze risk in multiple environmental
			media. In most cases, the process described has been used for a number
			of years on dozens of projects, with similar positive results. The purpose
			of documenting the process at this time is to:
			<ol>
			<li>
			Provide a ready source of information for training new project
			staff</li>

			<li>
			Improve the understanding of the process and thus acceptance
			of the final product</li>

			<li>
			Improve the reliability of software by ensuringthat  all staff are
			following the same protocols</li>

			<li>
			Improve the maintainability of software by attention to careful
			documentation of modifications.</li>
			</ol>
			The information provided should help clients, general users
			and project team members to understand the importance of ensuring quality
			in the software development life cycle.

			<p>A cornerstone of process is adherence to Laboratory
			standards. The Laboratory quality assurance standard states, "All staff
			shall document calculations, analyses, tests, and software required to
			substantiate results and processes used to develop products/solutions.
			Program managers shall manage assigned projects to a plan appropriately
			documents deliverables, budget, schedule, management methods, organization
			and control systems" (Laboratory quality assurance standard, Standards
			Based Management System, 1997b). In addition, the standard makes provisions
			for several levels of quality assurance, noting that
			<dir><i>When a project meets basic Battelle requirements
			(as provided in Standards-Based Management System A-manuals and subject
			areas) or other project or activity documents that sufficiently describe how
			customer requirements, drivers, and business, technical, or environment,
			safety and health risks are met, no additional quality assurance documentation
			is needed</i></dir>

			Accordingly, this document provides the standard quality assurance
			planning necessary for most projects to develop, modify, evaluate, or apply
			software to analyze risk in multiple environmental media (some projects
			will require an even higher lever of assurance based on client needs).

			<p>The Laboratory also has a software development standard
			(Laboratory computer software and database control standard, Standards
			Based Management System, 1997a) that embodies the quality standard and
			takes several steps further. The standard requires that 
			<dir><i>Management shall promote utilization of recognized
			system life-cycle management techniques to ensure quality and repeatable
			delivery of information systems and infrastructure services to both internal
			and external customers. Staff shall take reasonable actions to safeguard
			the Laboratory, Battelle, and client information assets, and computing and
			communications applications and resources against theft, loss, misuse and
			disruption</i>.</dir>
			Accordingly, this document describes how quality is managed
			throughout the system life cycle for environmental software systems (development,
			modification, testing, implementation, and application) and security measures
			commonly in place throughout Laboratory.

<p><a NAME="1_2"></a><b>1.2 Philosophy of System Development</b>
			<p>We define quality as the ability of system to meet
			client needs. Meeting client needs starts with a shared understanding of
			how the software must perform. It continues throughout the software life
			cycle through attention to details. For example, we use object-oriented
			programming constructs to control the flow of execution. This provides
			for well-defined interface points between modules and the easier maintenance
			of software. We also maintain a modular approach in the source program
			design and coding to ensure compatibility, easier testing, and clear communication
			points. Finally, we practice good documentation in naming conventions,
			symbolic parameters, paragraphing, blocking, indentation of source code,
			specification of a single statement per line, the intelligent use of comments
			and error messages so coding is easy to replicate, modify and maintain.
			These standard practices allow us to develop high-quality software systems
			that satisfy our clients.

<p><a NAME="1_3"></a><b>1.3 Scope of Document</b>
			<p>This document is meant to stand alone. The information
			contained within can be applied to most of the project team’s software
			systems to analyze risk in multiple environmental media, although in some
			cases client needs will require an even greater level of assurance. For
			specific projects, clients should refer to the proposal, statement of work,
			and/or project management plan for additional information on detailed
			quality requirements and activities being planned.

			<p>In some cases, our clients ask us to apply the models
			we develop to a particular problem or need (for example, in estimating
			risks of a major federal action for an environmental impact statement).
			Model application requires a different type of quality assurance process.
			One considers model selection, data collection, model implementation,
			sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, and anchoring. This type of quality
			assurance process is not addressed in this document.

<p><a NAME="1_4"></a><b>1.4 Document Overview</b>
			<p>The following sections provide an overview of software
			quality control and assurance activities associated with a software life
			cycle (development, modification, testing, implementation, and application).
			<a href="#2_0">Section 2</a> provides a historical perspective of the development of such systems
			as well as a general description of software systems and certain applications

<p><a NAME="2_0"></a><b>2.0 SOFTWARE SYSTEMS APPROACH</b>

			<p>The environmental software systems developed by the project
			team are designed using an object-oriented approach. These systems offer
			increased benefits over those of tthe raditional "hard wired" systems. Over
			the past 35 years, these traditional environmental software systems have
			been developed for specific media (soil, groundwater, surface water, air,
			etc.) in an effort to understand and predict environmental phenomena. Such
			systems are still being developed today. The evolution of these models
			has followed a logical progression:
			<ul>
			<li>
			In 1959, the Stanford Watershed Model was developed and represented
			as one of first "integrated" models, as it linked multiple processes by
			simulating the land-phase of a hydrologic cycle for an entire watershed.</li>

			<li>
			In 1969, Oak Ridge National Laboratory presented the Unified
			Transport Approach, which coupled (i.e., "hard-wired") detailed numerical
			models, describing individual environmental media. This model did not progress
			into general use because 1) models were difficult to understand, operate,
			modify, and maintain; 2) data to operate models were generally unavailable;
			and, most importantly, 3) computer power to drive system was lacking
			at time.</li>

			<li>
			In 1984, the introduction of desk-top computing allowed for the 
			first fully coupled sequential multiple media model, which accounted for
			temporally and spatially varying contamination within designated media.
			Each medium-specific model was "hard-wired" into system, so replacing
			these components was not easy.</li>

			<li>
			Around 1990, the development of large multi-purpose frameworks
			began, which "hard-wired" a suite of codes together and investigated not
			just the distribution of constituents in environment but the relationships
			between a suite of issues deemed valuable (e.g., regulatory criteria, data
			quality objectives, regulatory processes, etc.).</li>
			</ul>
			Unfortunately, one of the drawbacks of these "hard-wired"
			systems was in incorporating individual components.  The legacy of
			development and testing for the component was compromised. Even when these
			components could be incorporated intact, modifications were often necessary
			in other components. Therefore, the modification and maintenance of these
			systems were costly and time-consuming. A clear solution was to move toward
			a more object-oriented design, which is easier to maintain, retains development
			and testing legacy of individual components, and thus makes design and
			testing of models and future additions faster and less costly.

<p><a NAME="2_1"></a><b>2.1 Description of Systems</b>
			<p>That the project team develops software systems for risk analysis
			in multiple environmental media within a modular framework allows
			users the flexibility to construct, combine, and couple attributes
			meet their specific needs. This allows a variety of models to work within
			a single construct. There are two parts to these software systems: an overall
			system framework and a set of modules. Each module has three components:
			a user interface, a scientific model, and a pre/post-processor. Each of
			these pieces has a different set of quality criteria associated with it.

<BLOCKQUOTE><p><a NAME="2_1_1"></a><b>2.1.1 System Framework</b>
			<p>The system framework typically consists of a set of modules
			that have been specified by a client, an associated framework user interface,
			and data exchange specifications. The purpose of a system framework
			is to:
			<ul>
			<li>
			Minimize the data-exchange requirements between modules of
			framework system</li>

			<li>
			Allow relatively easy inclusion of additional modules and
			models</li>

			<li>
			Allow for unlimited access to data
			<li>
			Address linkage concerns for a variety of models.</li>
			</ul>
			The system framework typically includes a user-friendly interface
			to enable the user to access these capabilities easily.

			<p>Depending on client needs, the framework may accommodate
			various levels of the detail (i.e., resolution) of models and scale
			of assessment (e.g., medium-specific, watershed, regional, and global).
			It may also access a number of site- or installation-specific and national

			<p>Each system framework is developed and maintained by a
			team of researchers. The team consists of at least one subject matter expert
			(individual responsible for communicating client needs), a framework
			custodian (technical expert who oversees code development for system
			framework), and an application expert (someone with background in application
			of similar systems). There may also be component developers to assist
			framework custodian, testers, and technical reviewers for subject matter
			or code. Other project team members include the project custodian (who
			also serves as quality assurance/quality control manager), and a documentation
			manager (assigned to aid in development of documentation and/or online
			help programs), with an overall project manager providing client interface
			and leadership. At the onset of specific projects, the project manager
			selects appropriate individuals for each of these roles. Additional information
			on roles and functions of each of these team members can be found in
			Appendix B.

<p><a NAME="2_1_2"></a><b>2.1.2 Module</b>

			<p>Each module potentially contains three components:
			the user interface, the scientific model and, for those systems that incorporate
			legacy models, pre-and/or post-processors. Examples of modules include
			source term releases, vadose zone transport, saturated zone transport,
			surface water transport, air transport, exposure pathway analysis, dose
			estimates, health impacts, and sensitivity/uncertainty support tools.

			<p>Each module is developed and maintained by a team of researchers.
			For each module, there will be a subject matter expert (e.g., hydrologist
			for groundwater module, health physicist and biochemist for dose exposure
			module, etc.), a module custodian (technical expert who oversees code
			development for a module), and an application expert (someone with background
			in subject area and experience applying similar models). There may
			also component developers to assist module custodian, testers, a documentation
			manager assigned to aid in the development of documentation and/or online help
			programs, and technical reviewers for subject matter or code. Other
			project team members include the project custodian (who also serves as
			quality assurance/quality control manager) and task leader (generally
			in charge of development of each module), with an overall project manager
			providing client interface and leadership. At the onset of specific projects,
			the project manager selects appropriate individuals for each of these roles.
			Additional information on roles and functions of each of these team
			members can be found in <a href"appen_B.html">Appendix B.</a>

<BLOCKQUOTE><p><a NAME="2_1_2_1"></a><b>2.1.2.1 Model</b>

			<p>A model is set of scientific calculations define
			a particular module. Several models have been developed over the past 10
			years by researchers focusing on developing fully integrated, physics-based,
			intermedia modules that allow a more transparent connection between individual
			medium-specific models. The grouping of these physics-based models takes
			a holistic approach to the environmental assessment of potential constituent
			impacts as they simulate the following:
			<ol>
			<li>
			Release of constituents into environment</li>

			<li>
			Migration and fate through various environmental media (i.e.,
			groundwater, surface water, air, and overland surfaces)</li>

			<li>
			Resultant exposures and impacts</li>

			<li>
			Support tools such as sensitivity, uncertainty, graphical
			interface systems, and displaying results.</li>
			</ol>
			The overall scope of these models generally includes the evaluation
			of on- and off-site impacts from active and inactive sites involving both
			chemical and radioactive wastes. Although differing in their individual
			scopes, these multiple media models tend to be "analytical" in nature (e.g.,
			mainly compartmental, analytical, semi-analytical, and empirical algorithms).
			Other numerical or structured-value models can be used within this holistic
			approach or as an outside model.
<br><a NAME="2_1_2_2"></a><b>2.1.2.2 Module User Interface</b>
			<p>The purpose of the user interface to a module is to make it 
			easy to collect the data necessary to run model. Besides gathering
			necessary data, the user interface often provides online help to
			the user, reference storage options for collected data, flexible unit inputs,
			and other user support functions.

<p><a NAME="2_1_2_3"></a><b>2.1.2.3 Module Pre/Post-Processors</b>
			<p>As mentioned earlier, it saves time and cost if models
			can be integrated into a system framework intact. Legacy software
			has been tested and reviewed and can be preserved and integrated by the addition
			of pre- and/or post-processors to the module. These processors transfer
			reorganized data into specified format of overall framework, thus
			allowing the inclusion of modules that were initially created for a media-specific
			analysis to be used in this more holistic approach to multiple media assessments.
			Whether a pre/post-processor is used depends on the needs of the scientific
			model and the specification of the framework. Models have been created
			or modified with specifications predefined that will likely not need pre/post-processors
			before integration.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><a NAME="2_1_3"></a><b>2.1.3 User</b>
			<p>The anticipated user of this overall framework and its
			modules is expected to have some environmental science knowledge and to
			be familiar with standard Windows<sup>TM</sup> application software. In
			addition, completion of a training session or online tutorial is also recommended
			for potential users. Although user interfaces are generally written
			to be intuitive and user-friendly, the basic understanding of the proper use
			and interpretation of software is recommended.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><a NAME="2_2"></a><b>2.2 Information Security</b>
			<p>Whatever form our software systems might take for a particular
			client, standard processes apply to protect information from inappropriate
			use. These processes include application security, installation security,
			and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.

<BLOCKQUOTE><p><a NAME="2_2_1"></a><b>2.2.1 Applications Security</b>
			<p>All computer systems and related software at Laboratory
			are used for official business and activities sanctioned by management.
			Protection systems are in place to prevent sabotage or damage by viruses.
			Physical security measures include following:
			<ul>
			<li>
			Staff close and lock door to offices when systems will
			be left unattended for extended periods of time.</li>

			<li>
			Staff use protective measures such as screen savers and passwords.</li>

			<li>
			Staff know people who have routine access to area.</li>

			<li>
			Staff supervise use and maintenance of their systems.</li>

			<li>
			All systems are in managed buildings (access through security
			checkpoints).</li>

			<li>
			Approval is required before non-Laboratory personnel are
			granted access to computing resources.</li>

			<li>
			Backed up copies of software and files are stored in other
			locations (see information management below).</li>
			</ul>
			To protect against viruses, virus scans are performed monthly
			on all networked computers and at least quarterly on standalone models.
			In addition, all disks and files from unknown or questionable systems are
			scanned before use. The Laboratory uses a nationally recognized virus scanning
			program capable of identifying most forms of viruses including newer
			macro-viruses.

<p><a NAME="2_2_2"></a><b>2.2.2 Installation Security</b>

			<p>Most risk analysis software systems developed by the project
			team come in installation disk sets. Users generally install disks
			into the same directory or folder. To ensure ease of installation, all
			the software for risk analysis in multiple media is installed using general
			Windows installation procedures. These procedures prompt users through
			the installation process.

<p><a NAME="2_2_3"></a><b>2.2.3 Information Management</b>
			<p>All software systems covered by this approach are designed
			to meet client needs; each client receives specific information and software
			to this end. However, in all cases, master source codes remain
			the property of the Laboratory. Electronic copies are backed up and kept in
			at least two different buildings as well as on a networked fixed disk;
			a baseline printout is also kept separately. A completed form detailing
			all locations is kept by module or framework custodian for respective
			components as well as the project custodian. Additional guidance related
			to information management can be found in <a href="appen_a.html">Appendix A.</a></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><a NAME="2_3"></a><b>2.3 System Safeguards and Sensitivity</b>
			<p>These risk analysis software systems are generally used
			to estimate the impacts to human health from constituent releases to
			environment through several pathways of exposure. This information is generally
			used to hypothesize impacts from new constituent sources or changes to
			existing sources (such as effects from environmental remediation and restoration).
			This information can also be used to monitor compliance with environmental
			regulations. Clients may use it for a single activity or for analysis
			of a full suite of activities spanning multiple installations and locations.

			<p>Because ways in which software can be used differ
			between clients, the system’s sensitivity can also vary widely. Therefore,
			it is the client’s responsibility to determine the appropriate safeguards and
			security necessary for their particular use. Project staff will discuss
			this need with the client early in the planning process so that the client
			requirements can be built into the system development.

<p><a NAME="2_4"></a><b>2.4 Potential Electronic Tracking
			System</b>
			<p>The processes detailed in this report are currently tracked
			via an electronic spreadsheet program. There are, however, an increasing
			number of automated software quality assurance tools designed for Internet,
			Intranet, and web-based use that can be considered to save time and money.
			Change request tools introduce a consistency of communication that makes
			data gathering a simple, painless process and encourages people to report
			defects and testing time. Enhancement requests, defect reports, and changes
			can be easily managed from the initial incident through resolution and testing.
			Version control management tools can reduce the risk of change by enforcing
			and recording change process. The right change request and version
			control tools can save time, ease software maintenance, and coordinate
			the work of multiple team members. The project team is currently investigating
			the utility and feasibility of incorporating one or more of these tools
			to maximize quality assurance process for clients.

<p><a NAME="2_5"></a><b>2.5 Performance Metrics</b>
			<p>The performance metrics for this approach considers eight
			areas: compatibility, completeness, consistency, correctness, the ability to
			be modified, robustness, understandability, and testability. Many of these
			areas are generally addressed in our standard use of object-oriented design.
			The following are examples of performance metrics specific to four
			pieces of software described above <a href="#2_1">(Section 2.1).</a>

<p><a NAME="3_0"></a><b>3.0 SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT</b>

			<p>Software systems, developed by the project team, to analyze
			risk in multiple environmental media follows a routine process (Figure
			3.1), honed by years of experience with a variety of clients. This development
			is influenced by client needs for information output, programming standards
			and languages, and the development tools available. In general, this process
			entails an analysis of client requirements, the design of the system to
			meet those requirements, and production and programming, including testing.
			The guidance discussed in the following sections can be found in <a href="appen_a.html">Appendix
			A.</a> <a href="appen_B.html">Appendix B</a> describes the responsibilities of various roles discussed.

<p><a NAME="3_1"></a><b>3.1 System Detailed Requirements
			Analysis</b>
			<p>Each project starts with a definition of the client’s
			needs. What problem must be solved? What kinds of information are needed?
			Who are the ultimate users and how can the system best meet their needs?
			This definition begins with an analysis of needs, a definition of
			the functional components of hardware and software, and packaging of
			information.

<BLOCKQUOTE><p><a NAME="3_1_1"></a><b>3.1.1 Requirements Analysis</b>
			<p>The requirements analysis is based on communication with
			the client and historical use of these software systems by the project
			team. The project team has years of experience in analyzing environmental
			issues and has developed significant tools for use in understanding these
			issues. This experience along with understanding specific needs of
			client is the basis for the requirements analysis, which is documented
			in a proposal or statement of work for the client.

			<p>An important part of the requirements analysis is to define
			functional components of hardware and software. These components are
			determined by the client’s hardware environment and the environments of
			legacy software being incorporated into the system.

<p><a NAME="3_1_2"></a><b>3.1.2 Requirements Documentation</b>
			<p>The information developed during the requirements analysis
			phase of project is gathered into the requirements package. This requirements
			description includes two levels of detail, general requirements and specific
			requirements. Many of the general requirements are described in project
			documentation, such as the project management plan with task descriptions
			and/or a statement of work for the project to ensure accuracy and client
			understanding and support. Thr statement of work is approved by the client
			before the initiation of work (the project management plan or statement
			of work contains similar information as in U.S. Environmental
			Protection Agency’s "System Implementation Plan" and "Software Management
			Plan," Essential Elements of Information 4 and 6, respectively, in EPA
			1997).

			<p>In addition to the statement of work and task descriptions,
			additional general requirements can be documented and included into
			the requirements package. The requirements package should be sufficiently detailed
			to be used as the foundation for design and testing (the requirements
			package contains similar information as in EPA’s "System Detailed
			Requirements Document," Essential Element of Information 5 in EPA 1997).

			<p><b>Figure 3.1. Process for Developing Environmental Software Systems</b>
			<p>The information in the requirements package should, at
			a minimum, answer the following questions:

			<ul>
			<li>
			Which capabilities have been discussed with the client (which
			are they expecting the project team to use on this project)?</li>

			<li>
			What additional capabilities are necessary to produce a quality
			product?</li>

			<li>
			What specific restrictions have been noted?</li>

			<li>
			What potential difficulties have been identified?</li>

			<li>
			What compatibilities are necessary for usability (confirm
			compatibility with client’s systems)?</li>

			<li>
			Who are the project team members (subject matter expert,
			module or framework custodian, application expert, etc.)?</li>
			</ul>
			Specific requirements for a system framework include the following:
			<ul>
			<li>
			Module data interaction specifications</li>

			<li>
			Mathematical formulations</li>

			<li>
			File formats descriptions for those files that do not
			meet framework system-level specifications</li>

			<li>
			Necessary help information</li>

			<li>
			Identification of ways to ensure a consistent look and feel
			with related interfaces</li>

			<li>
			Expected deliverables for task.</li>
			</ul></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><a NAME="3_2"></a><b>3.2 System Design and Development</b>
			<p>The system design and development is the process of taking
			the information in the requirements package and translating it into software.
			This process is led by a module or framework custodian (see Appendix B for
			a full description of roles and responsibilities for this person),
			who may have assistance from other code developers as well as a subject
			matter expert. When this process has been completed, any changes to
			the software must be approved by the task leader and project manager.

<BLOCKQUOTE><p><p><a NAME="3_2_1"></a><b>3.2.1 Definition of Database and File Structure</b>
			<p>Before the code is designed, the module or framework custodian
			(depending on component) must determine appropriate databases and
			file the structures of input and output from them. Module file structure
			should be consistent with the framework’s file specification format. Pre/post-processors
			may be used to aid in the conversion of legacy code file formats not already
			meeting those specifications. All file formats should be designed to ensure
			the readability and compatibility with most spreadsheet programs, and to incorporate
			the necessary information to communicate use and purpose of each file.

<p><a NAME="3_2_2"></a><b>3.2.2 Code Design and Development</b>
			<p>the code design begins with a description by the module
			custodians and framework custodian of major components of the design
			as they relate to requirements identified in the requirements analysis
			phase of the project. Flowcharts, block diagrams, and the relational matrix
			are often used to describe linkages and solution strategy. Guidance
			describing multiple steps involved in the design and development of software
			systems can be found in <a href="appen_a.html">Appendix A.</a>

<p><a NAME="3_2_3"></a><b>3.2.3 Development of Software User’s Guidance</b>
			<p>Software user guidance is developed for each module or
			framework. This user’s guidance, often in the form of online help, is generally
			an associated real-time system using hypertext language. However this type
			of help information is also made available for printing in hard copy form
			to function as a traditional user’s guide (user guidance, along with
			training discussed in Section 6.0, contains similar information as
			in EPA’s "Software Operations Document" and "Software User’s Reference
			Guide," Essential Elements of Information 10 and 11 in EPA 1997).

			<p>In addition, online tutorials may be developed for specified
			software systems. These tutorials would serve as a supplement or replacement
			to traditional client training arranged to aid in system implementation.
			These tutorials are intended to communicate the necessary information
			needed to operate the system correctly. Information is provided on
			the operation of the user interface and underlying models and their appropriate
			use. The development of an online tutorial is determined in the project
			management plan or statement of work.

<p><a NAME="3_2_4"></a><b>3.2.4 Design and Development Documentation</b>
			<p>The design and development activities are captured in
			a software development package, which identifies the type of code (new,
			replacement, upgrade) and members of the development team. It provides
			a generic description of the code, often in the form of a flowchart or
			task description. It also lists deliverables specific to the task such
			as the requirements analysis, user guidance, and testing approach. The software
			development package is helpful throughout the process because it captures
			the developers’ understanding of requirements and provides an opportunity
			for internal and external reviews of the design (software development
			package contains information similar to in EPA’s "Software Design
			Document," Essential Element of Information 8 in EPA 1997).

			<p>Code testing is also documented in the software development
			package as well as the software test package. The software development
			package contains a copy of the software test package and is signed by the 
			application expert. A description of what comprises a software test package
			can be found in <a href="#5_0">Section 5</a>.

			<p>When completed, the software development package is reviewed
			by the task leader, subject matter expert, and a module or framework custodian
			(depending on component), and application expert. The information includes
			a baseline hard copy of source code listing as well as a diskette copy
			labeled with the component name, version, component developer names, and date.
			The diskette includes source codes, any executable files, and any "readme"
			files with special instructions to users. The package also documents
			the computer programming language used and any other additional languages used.
			Changes to components of software after the software development
			package is complete require the additional signature of the task leader.

<p><a NAME="4_0"></a><b>4.0 SYSTEM MODIFICATION</b>

			<p>Over the years, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
			has developed a variety of software systems for risk analysis in multiple
			environmental media such as MEPAS, RAAS, GENII, and others. While some
			client needs necessitate development of entirely new systems, often
			modifications to the existing systems are more cost-effective and useful. Modifications
			are influenced by programming language constraints, detailed user requirements,
			data requirements, and physical environment. The approach to modifications
			is detailed below. Descriptions of the roles and responsibilities of key
			project staff can be found in <a href="appen_B.html">Appendix B.</a> Example forms currently used
			in software modification tracking can be found in <a href="appen_C.html">Appendix C.</a>

<p><a NAME="4_1"></a><b>4.1 Performance Metrics Development</b>
			<p>As mentioned in Section 2.5, the performance metrics for
			our environmental software systems consider eight areas: compatibility,
			completeness, consistency, correctness, the ability to be modified, robustness,
			understandability, and testability. Many of these areas are addressed in
			our standard approach of object-oriented design and thus have been addressed
			in the development of the original systems. These systems may be modified
			for one of two reasons: either a client or other user has suggested an
			enhancement they would like to purchase or the project team or user has
			identified an error or "bug" in the system. The following are examples
			of performance metrics specific to these types of modifications.

<BLOCKQUOTE><p><a NAME="4_1_1"></a><b>4.1.1 Enhancements</b>
			<p>An enhancement might be made to the framework system or
			one of modules. When enhancing a system framework, answering yes to
			following questions indicates that the system will perform in accordance
			with quality expectations:
			<ul>
			<li>
			Were modifications evaluated for appropriateness and feasibility?</li>

			<li>
			Were modifications to data communication specifications documented?</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
			<li>
			Were modifications approved by the subject area expert, applications
			expert, and framework custodian?</li>

			<li>
			Were modifications documented in such a way as to ensure
			reproducibility of the process?</li>

			<li>
			Did the baseline test cases reproduce expected results?</li>
			</ul>
			When enhancing a module, answering yes to following questions
			indicates that the module will perform in accordance with quality expectations:
			<ul>
			<li>
			Were modifications evaluated for appropriateness and feasibility?</li>

			<li>
			Were modifications to model formulations documented?</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
			<li>
			Were modifications approved by the subject area expert?</li>

			<li>
			Were modifications documented in such a way as to ensure
			reproducibility of the process?</li>

			<li>
			Did the baseline test cases reproduce expected results?</li>
			</ul>

<p><a NAME="4_1_2"></a><b>4.1.2 Errors and Bugs</b>
			<p>Once a potential problem with the system has been identified,
			the project team attempts to reproduce the problem (i.e., determine
			the steps that led to the error message or other problem). From this, the information,
			module or framework custodian (depending on component) identifies a
			potential way to fix the problem; the proposed method is approved by
			the cognizant subject matter expert. When implementing the proposed change
			in the system, answering yes to the following questions indicates
			that the problem has been solved:
			<ul>
			<li>
			Was the change evaluated for appropriateness and effect of
			other segments of code?</li>

			<li>
			Was the change approved by the subject area expert for a
			module or subject matter expert, framework custodian, and application
			expert for a framework?</li>

			<li>
			Was the change documented is such a way as to ensure
			that the steps taken can be reproduced?</li>

			<li>
			Were the baseline test cases reproduced with the expected affect
			on results?</li>
			</ul></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><a NAME="4_2"></a><b>4.2 System Modification Documentation</b>
			<p>Once a software system has been developed to a baseline,
			modifications must be planned carefully to ensure a minimal impact on existing
			users. The key to this is the tracking of requested changes and their expected
			impacts on results (three pieces described below—change request, change
			documentation, and change request summary—contain information similar to
			in EPA’s "Software Maintenance Document," Essential Element of Information
			9 in EPA 1997).

<BLOCKQUOTE><p><a NAME="4_2_1"></a><b>4.2.1 Change Request</b>
			<p>A change request may originate from a client, a project
			team member the client has contacted, or a project team member who has
			identified a need for a system modification. The process serves several
			purposes:
			<ul>
			<li>
			Provides information on the potential location of the problem
			or enhancement</li>

			<li>
			Identifies rhe problem or enhancement</li>

			<li>
			Provides information to determine the priority of the problem
			or enhancement</li>

			<li>
			Documents under what circumstances the problem occurs</li>

			<li>
			Provides for concurrence between the framework or model custodian,
			subject matter expert, and application expert.</li>
			</ul>
			Sometimes circumstances prevent the suggested change from
			being implemented. For example, enhancements may be suggested for which
			a client is uninterested in paying or someone may report an error in an
			outdated version of code. However, the change request is documented regardless
			of whether the change is actually implemented. This enables staff to track
			issues that, while not key to improvements today, may require action later.

			<p>A change request may involve more than one problem/enhancement;
			in some cases, several related problems are reported at one time. The request
			is duplicated later in the process when each change is assigned a method
			of correction.

			<p>Once a change request has been initiated, it is routed
			through the project custodian, who will assign a tracking number, enter
			that number into a database, and distribute the information to the affected
			module or framework custodian(s). Sometimes a problem is so critical that 
			time does not permit the physical routing of change request. In this
			case, the project staff send an electronic mail message to the project custodian
			with a brief explanation of change. This information will be entered
			into the database and a tracking number will be returned to the sender.
			Sometimes it is unclear as to which modules are involved/affected by
			the proposed change. In this case, the project custodian assigns a temporary
			tracking number until the change can be further evaluated by the module
			or framework custodian.

<p><a NAME="4_2_2"></a><b>4.2.2 Change Documentation</b>
			<p>Once a change has been documented in the change request
			process, the module custodian completes an evaluation of the change, which
			they then submit to the subject matter expert for approval and a signature
			(at this point, multiple change requests that were submitted together can
			be distributed so each change can be tracked separately). If the change
			affects the system framework, an approval is based on a concurrence between
			the subject matter expert, framework custodian, and the application expert.
			The change attachment serves to document the following:
			<ul>
			<li>
			Evaluation of the problem or enhancement by the subject
			matter expert(s)</li>

			<li>
			Changes made to code</li>

			<li>
			Tests run to ensure that the changes work properly</li>

			<li>
			Team members involved in the decision and change process.</li>
			</ul>
			If the change is denied, the module or framework custodian
			provides the completed change package to the project custodian for archiving.
			If the change is approved, the module or framework custodian begins the design and
			implementation of the proposed change. The application expert then tests
			the changes made with a baseline set of scenarios and any other testing
			scenarios necessary to confirm the expected affects of the change.
			The module custodian also provides information to explain what changes were
			implemented and how. Examples of such documentation includes printouts
			of screens, code comparisons, etc.
			<p>If a solution triggers another problem or needed enhancement,
			the module or framework custodian makes another change request and
			the process begins again.

<p><a NAME="4_2_3"></a><b>4.2.3 Change Request Summary</b>
			<p>When a change has been implemented, the module or framework
			custodian (depending on component being changed) keeps a copy of the completed
			change package and returns the original to the project custodian, who prepares
			a change request summary. This package serves to:
			<ul>
			<li>
			Summarize information from the change request form</li>

			<li>
			Document the reviews and approvals of the subject matter experts
			and module or framework custodians</li>

			<li>
			Document the source code and backup updates.</li>
			</ul>
			The project custodian files the change request, change package,
			change request summary, and any associated documentation for later reference.
			Copies of requests originated by a client are also placed in the client
			folder.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><a NAME="4_3"></a><b>4.3 Design and Development</b>
			<p>Modification design and development follow similar guidance
			to the new system development process found in Section 3.2. After the initial
			evaluation of modification and its potential impacts to existing code
			and results, the system is modified and tested. Other design issues considered
			by project team might include the following:
			<ul>
			<li>
			Impacts to the software user’s guidance</li>

			<li>
			Information for updating the software development package</li>

			<li>
			Potential additional reviews.</li>
			</ul>

<p><a NAME="5_0"></a><b>5.0 SYSTEM INTEGRATION, TESTING, AND EVALUATION</b>

			<p>All environmental software systems developed by the project
			team are tested by developers before use external to Pacific Northwest
			National Laboratory. Each component is individually tested, and the entire
			system is tested to ensure compatibility. The software test package is
			developed by the application expert and is based on requirements for
			the system framework or module being tested. The test package may also
			be evaluated by an independent tester to ensure completeness and accurate
			results. Testing can often produce additional change to an already baselined
			system. In this case, recommended changes to the software are routed through
			the modification process to ensure the feasibility of those recommended changes
			(modification process is discussed in Section 4.0). The testing and
			evaluation of results is handled slightly differently for new systems verses
			changes to existing systems, as detailed below.

<p><a NAME="5_1"></a><b>5.1 New Systems</b>
			<p>Testing of newly developed software is key in the environmental
			software systems quality process (see Figure 3.1). Tests are documented
			in the software development package as well as the software test package.
			Subject area experts and module or framework custodians provide information
			to the application expert to summarize the reason for performing the tests
			and to contribute to the scope of the test. The scope information may include
			information on the software and documentation being tested, specific
			features to be tested, test case specifications, and any features
			that are to be excluded from testing and why. The foundation of testing
			is the requirements outlined in the requirements package and the development
			package (software test package and test results contain similar information
			to EPA’s "Software Test and Acceptance Plan" and "System Integration Test
			Reports," Essential Elements of Information 7 and 12, respectively, in
			EPA 1997).

			<p>Before testing, the application expert identifies major
			testing tasks, activities, techniques, and tools necessary to prepare for
			and perform testing. They also identify pass/fail criteria for each item,
			suspension/resumption criteria, and test deliverables. Finally, they identify
			the staff responsible for managing, designing, preparing, executing, and
			evaluating tests.

			<p>The application expert then prepares procedural steps
			for the test, describing such things as:
			<ul>
			<li>
			Sequence of actions necessary for preparation before
			and during execution of the test</li>

			<li>
			Methods or formats for logging results of test execution
			and test incidents</li>

			<li>
			How test measurements will be made</li>

			<li>
			Sequence of actions necessary for shutdown, restart,
			execution halt, and restoration of hardware/software environment</li>

			<li>
			Actions necessary for dealing with anomalies that may
			occur during execution of the test.</li>
			</ul>
			For each test case, the module or framework custodians also note:
			<ul>
			<li>
			<u>Logistic Information</u>--unique identifier assigned
			to test case specification, a brief description of items and features
			to be exercised by the test case, rationale for the selection of the test case,
			and pass/fail criteria for all features to be tested.</li>

			<li>
			<u>Input/Output Specifications</u>--all inputs and relationships
			among inputs required to execute the test case as well as all outputs and
			features required of test items.</li>

			<li>
			<u>Requirements/Resources</u>--characteristics and configurations
			of any hardware, software, or unique facility required to execute the test
			case as well as any constraints on the test executes test case
			and any dependencies between test cases.</li>
			</ul>
			At the conclusion of the testing, the applications expert,
			subject matter expert, and the module or framework custodian agree to the comprehensiveness
			of testing. A baseline set of test cases is documented as well as their
			results. These baseline test cases will be used to confirm the continued
			integrity of the software system when future modifications are made.

<p><a NAME="5_2"></a><b>5.2 Modified Systems</b>
			<p>For modified systems, baseline test cases are used
			for confirming the effects on the overall code in addition to testing needs
			identified in the evaluation, design, or change process. Often changes
			are minor enough that minimal testing is required to ensure accurate implementation.
			In this case, the application expert conducts the test and provides a printout 
			to the project custodian for inclusion into the change control files
			discussed in Section 4.0. When the modifications are extensive, the application
			expert follows the same process as noted above for the testing of new systems.

<p><a NAME="5_3"></a><b>5.3 General Test Scenarios</b>
			<p>General test scenarios are prepared for new and existing
			software that is being introduced into this system quality approach. These
			scenarios are described as the minimum set of scenarios that are necessary
			to ensure correctness of the software produced.
			<p>For a framework system, the scenarios evaluated are based
			on user-friendliness and module-accessibility. Examples of the areas tested
			for framework systems include correct file execution, accurate file communication,
			and user-understandability.
			<p>For a module user interface, the scenarios evaluated are
			based on user-friendliness and accuracy in the data gathered for the model.
			Examples of the areas tested for the module user interface include the representation
			of model capabilities, accurate file communication, and user-understandability.
			<p>For a model, the scenarios evaluated are based on
			formulations and the purpose of model. Examples of areas tested for
			models include the correct implementation of formulations, accurate input/output
			data communication, and the potential combination of options.
			<p>For pre/post processors, scenarios evaluated are based
			on the correct data transfer and compliance with the system framework file
			specifications.

<p><a NAME="6_0"></a><b>6.0 SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION</b>

			<p>The last phase of software development and ensuring quality
			is system implementation; however, expectations for the system implementation
			were first introduced in the requirements analysis phase of project.
			Implementation means that the specific framework developed for client
			can be transferred to the client to be applied at their organization by
			their own staff. How this system is implemented is influenced by system
			development, user acceptance, and operations constraints, as discussed
			below.

<p><a NAME="6_1"></a><b>6.1 Technology Transfer</b>
			<p>The transfer of usable software to the client is based
			on details depicted in a statement of work or project management
			plan. Client agreements are often arranged with a requirement
			software to be user-friendly and operable by a non-project team individual.
			The level of client implementation support is arranged to aid the end user
			of the software tool in adjusting to the look and feel of the system.

	<BLOCKQUOTE><p><a NAME="6_1_1"></a><b>6.1.1 Client Implementation Support</b>
			<p>Project agreements often include a client implementation
			support phase comprised of the  delivery of software to a client and a
			trial time with client support through initial software usage. This support
			may be offered over phone, at the client location, or in training sessions
			on use and foundations of the software being delivered. Technical support
			can also be negotiated beyond the initial project agreement to enable a
			client to expand on software capabilities or to aid in a client’s application
			of software tools.

		<p><a NAME="6_1_2"></a><b>6.1.2 Implementation Documentation</b>
			<p>Implementation documentation is usually offered as an
			online feature of the software system with additional documentation of
			file specification and formulations also available. Additional information
			on software user’s guidance can be found in Section 3.2.3.
		<p><a NAME="6_1_3"></a><b>6.1.3 User Training</b>
			<p>Training on the appropriate use of the software system
			is recommended. This training should include information such as the capabilities
			of the user interfaces, reasoning for the formulations that were implemented,
			and limitations of the system produced. This training may occur through
			a formal training session, technical support of individual users, an on-line
			tutorial, or another form of communication capabilities.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><a NAME="6_2"></a><b>6.2 System Operations and Maintenance</b>
			<p>The system operations and maintenance depends on the scope
			of the project. In some cases, the operation and maintenance is included
			in the project and therefore falls into modification aspects of this
			document (Section 4.0). In other cases, the project ends upon delivery of
			the software to client; in this case, the client could negotiate continued
			system maintenance for future use. Guidance of the proper use and operation
			of the system is provided in user training as discussed above. Documentation
			packages gathered for developed software systems are maintained and stored
			for the life of the product.
