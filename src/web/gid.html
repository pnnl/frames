<h2>Global Input Data File (GID)</h2>
The GID file is a file that contains all the data the user inputs. These data, because they may be changed at will by the user, need to be able to be changed or added to in an efficient way. The GID file is organized in sections to facilitate model input and output. Four of the standard GID sections are the following: FUI, CSM, CON, and EBF. Most modules typically take in the Framework User Interface (FUI) and Conceptual Site Model (CSM) as these are the sections that define what the scenario looks like and what connections have been made.  Additionally, most modules take in the Constituent Database section of the GID file, as this provides all the constituent data.  The ecological modules typically take in the Ecological Benchmark File (EBF) along with the CON, to provide additional information on the lifeforms being modeled.
<p>
To this end, and in keeping with the idea that all values should be readily understood by a human reader, the specification for the Global Input Data file is:
<br>
<br>For each Parameter a line with:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parameter Name - (string)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Index 1 - (integer)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Index 2 - (integer)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Index 3 - (integer)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Index 4 - (integer)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Index 5 - (integer)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Index 6 - (integer)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference - (integer)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User Units - (string)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units - (string)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Value - (string), (integer), or (float)
<br>Example Lines
<br>"Sites",0,0,0,0,0,0,112,"N/A","N/A",1
<br>"NumCon",1,0,0,0,0,0,16,"N/A","N/A",10
<br>"VadVeloc",1,1,1,0,0,0,1000,"ft/d","cm/s",10.6
<p>All values are stored as text, this allows each module to use its own storage format (Big-Endian, Little-Endian, 32 bit real, 64 bit real ...). The number of digits of precision should be set by the model developer when floating point numbers are being written. The choice of 6 dimensions is somewhat arbitrary in as much as it is the dimensional limit of some versions of FORTRAN.
<p>To make the reading of the GID file more efficient markers are used to mark the beginning of a section of data for a particular module. A marker consists of a name and the number of lines in that block of information. In every GID file there will be a "FUI" data block that contains the information maintained by the Framework User Interface (FUI).
<p>The following pages contain information that specifies the information the Framework User Interface (FUI) will maintain. The dimension and names of data for a Module User Interface(MUI) is up to the individual modeler.
<p>All measurements in the FUI are related to an appropriate point for all the models used in a GID file. This allows each application of the FUI to use a Cartesian Coordinate that is convenient for that application with out losing meaning. For example at the Hanford Site an analysis was done using state plane coordinates, but a small site might use the center point of the source as the reference point.
<p>In the listing below every entry is made up of two lines. The first is a short text description of the parameter. The second line contains four pieces of information Name of the Parameter, Dimensions of the parameter, Model units of the parameter, and Type. Dimensions are given a name such. Some Dimensions may not always be used this is indicated by a {} being used. An example is {Progeny}. Type is limited to (integer),(float), or (string). In some instances extra lines of information follow, the two required lines, to list or describe further the information stored with a parameter name.
