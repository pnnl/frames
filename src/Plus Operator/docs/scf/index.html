  <b>THE SCF PLUS OPERATOR IS CURRENTLY UNFINISHED</b><br/>

  The SCF plus operator functionality is basic.  SCF's are only merged
  when their volume sources match.  When they match, they are merged
  just like WCF.  If there is no match, another volume source is
  created in the result dataset and the data stored there.
