 Unlike ATO, I think WCF leaves few, if any, shaded areas that might need to be cleared up.  I cannot think of any off the top of my head.  Please let me know of any.  Meanwhile reading <a href="../Plus Operator Requirements Summary.wpd">Gene's document</a> should clear up most questions.

  I have one simple test for WCF are in docs/wcf/tests, which is what I used to validate the wcf plus operator.
