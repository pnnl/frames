  <p>
   Copy the files from the plus operator Source safe root to the
   frames directory.  There should be a des file for each plus type,
   in addition to the plus.exe.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you want to recompile, you will need VC++6.0 or higher.  After
   compiling, just copy the exe over to the frames directory.  
  </p>
  <p>
   Use the des files in the plus operator root directory to interface
   FRAMES with the plus operator.  Of course, you can disect the des
   files to figure out how the plus operator is invoked for the
   various types (such as ato or wcf).

  <p>
   Visit the docs/ato/tests folder for the tests I used while testing
 the ato operator.<br/>
   There is also a simple test I used for testing wcf in the
 docs/wcf/tests folder, as well as docs/scf/test.
