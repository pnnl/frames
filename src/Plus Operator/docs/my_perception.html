 My perception
</h2>
<p>
  I provide this section so that you can see where I am coming from in
  the case that I misinterpret the way something works.
</p>
<p>
 <li>A simulation is a bunch of modules connected together by lines in
 the FRAMES environment.  Each module specifies required and optional
 input and output types.  This specification determines which modules
 will be connected as input and output.  One module gets the ball
 rolling by processing it's user input data, then sending it's output
 to the modules connected to it's output slots.  Those modules then
 process this input data, and send it to their output slots.  This
 repeats until the last module, with no outputs defined, is reached.
 </li>
 <li>A gid file defines this simulation.  It stores the module
 properties such as name and GUI positioning of the icon representing
 the module in the simulation.  It also defines which modules are
 connected as inputs and as outputs.
 </li>
 <li>All datasets of the same type are stored in the same file.  For
 example, ATO datasets are stored in .ato file.are stored in one file,
 in no necessary order.
 </li>
 <li>Merging, adding, interpolating, unioning, superpositioning...I
 use most of these words to mean the same thing.  I do however, try to
 use the word most suitable for the context in which it is used, as I
 know that they all have different meanings.
