The FRAMES chemical database editor (CDBE) allows the user to view parameters
in the database, select constituents for an analysis, and maintain values in
the database by editing values for current constituents, adding new
constituents, and saving multiple versions of a database for specific
applications.&nbsp; The parameters in the database are described in this help
file.&nbsp; The information provided includes the parameter name as used on the
screen, the units for the parameter, the valid range for the parameter, and a
description of the parameter.&nbsp; <b>References</b> cited are included at the end
of this file.

The CDBE contains several correlation relationships that the user can employ to
provide estimates for property values.&nbsp; These relationships are defined in
this section, and are the same as those previously provided in MMEDE (with
exceptions noted).&nbsp; The estimation methods, screen layout, and save
options in CDBE should be the same as or extensions of the method in MMEDE.

Units: mm Hg <br>
Range: 0 to 5000

<p>The vapor pressure of a chemical is the pressure exerted by its vapor, at a
given temperature, in equilibrium with the pure compound (liquid or
solid).&nbsp; The vapor pressure is used to define the volatility of the
chemical.&nbsp; Most inorganic solid compounds will have a value of zero.&nbsp;
Gases generally have a value of at least 760 mm Hg (1 atmosphere).&nbsp;
Because vapor pressure is temperature dependent, the temperature at which the
value is defined should be entered in the field &quot;Vapor Pressure Temperature&quot;.
Sources for water solubility include <b>Mackay et al.&nbsp; (1992)</b> and <b>Howard
and Meylan (1997)</b>.

<hr align=left width="30%"><a name=CLVPT></a><b>Vapor Pressure Temperature</b> (CLVPT) <br>
Units: deg.&nbsp; C <br>

Range: 0 to 5000

<p>The molar volume is the volume occupied by 1 g-mole of a chemical at 1
atmosphere pressure at the temperature defined by &quot;Molar Volume
Temperature&quot;.&nbsp; For an ideal gas, the molar volume at 0ºC is 2.2414x10<sup>4</sup>
cm<sup>3</sup>/mol.&nbsp; Some sources refer to this parameter as the molecular
volume.&nbsp; However, in this database, the molecular volume is defined as the
volume of one molecule (see Molecular Volume).

<p>The surface tension temperature is the temperature corresponding to the surface
tension value.

<hr align=left width="30%"><a name=CLVISC></a><b>Dynamic Viscosity</b> (CLVISC) <br>
Units: centipoise <br>
Range: 0 to 10,000

<p>The dynamic viscosity (absolute viscosity) is a measure of the resistance to
change of form of a substance.&nbsp; Although defined primarily for fluids
(liquids and vapors) some solids also show a gradual change is shape under
applied force.&nbsp; Dynamic viscosity is related to kinematic viscosity as
follows:
