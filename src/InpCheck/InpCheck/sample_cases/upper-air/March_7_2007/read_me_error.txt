I just got back from travel this morning.  I haven't gotten a successful calmet run while I was gone.  Here's the latest error...  it appears to be complaining that this level has missing data, but it does not.  I've culled out all levels that have any missing data, which leaves about 10 levels on average. 


ERROR IN SUBR. RDUP -- missing sounding data yr = 2007   Julian day =  66  hour (GMT) =  0   station =   1   level =   7 pres. =   250.0   elev. =  10370.   temp. =   216.1   dir = 290.0   ws =  37.0

I thought I would shout to the world..... I got calmet to run.  The last error is apparently due to the fact that calmet doesn't like readings above 10000 m (about 250 mb).  I switched it back to having the top level be 400 mb.  I had changed it to use data up to 100mb since the FSL feed last week consistently had missing data at 400mb which caused problems.  I've switched back to using the COD feed, which has many levels without missing data that are useful.  And as I said Monday, am augmenting the mesowest feed with the original NOAA feed to make sure the surface data isn't missing either.

So, let's see what the rest of the day may bring - let's keep our fingers crossed...
