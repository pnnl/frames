TmpKnown - This is a set of pre-selected GENII modules that provide a starting place for various scenarios in which the air, surface water, and/or groundwater concentrations of radioactive contaminants are already known.  The user needs to select the contaminants with the Constituent Editor, and then input the known transport pathway concentrations in the User-Defined input module(s).  (If one of the selected user-defined modules is not needed, it may be removed using the right-click/delete option.)  The GENII Chronic Exposure Module is used to estimate accumulation in the biosphere. Human exposure is defined in the GENII Receptor Intake module, and the GENII Health Impacts module provides estimation of dose and/or risk.
