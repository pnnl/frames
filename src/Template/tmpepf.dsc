TmpEPF - This is a set of pre-selected GENII modules that provide a starting place for a simple scenario in which the environmental concentrations of radioactive contaminants are already known.  The user needs to select the contaminants with the Constituent Editor, and then input the known pathway concentrations in the User-Defined input module.  Human exposure is defined in the GENII Receptor Intake module, and the GENII Health Impacts module provides estimation of dose and/or risk.
