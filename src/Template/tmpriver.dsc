TmpRiver - This is a set of pre-selected GENII modules that provide a starting place for scenarios in which release of radioactive materials to surface water are known.  The user needs to select the contaminants with the Constituent Editor, and then input the releases in the User-Defined input module.  The GENII surface water module is used to estimate concentrations in streams, lakes, or rivers. The GENII Chronic Exposure Module is used to estimate accumulation in the biosphere. Human exposure is defined in the GENII Receptor Intake module, and the GENII Health Impacts module provides estimation of dose and/or risk.
