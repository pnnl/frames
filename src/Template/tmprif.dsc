TmpRIF - This is a set of pre-selected GENII modules that provide a starting place for calculations in which the actual intake (ingestion, inhalation) of radioactive contaminants by the receptor is known.  The user needs to select the contaminants with the Constituent Editor, and then input the exposures in the User-Defined Receptor Intakes input module.  The GENII Health Impacts module provides estimation of dose and/or risk.  This is one of the simplest calculations that can be made with the FRAMES/GENII system.
