Templt01 - This is a set of pre-selected GENII files that provide a starting place for a scenario of chronic atmospheric releases from a single source, using the GENII Chronic Plume dispersion module to estimate the atmospheric dispersion, the GENII Chronic Exposure Module to estimate accumulation in the biosphere, the GENII Receptor Intake module to describe human behavior in the scenario, the GENII Health Impacts module for estimation of dose and/or risk, and the GENII Report Generator to summarize the outputs.
