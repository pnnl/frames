 Inhalation impacts calculated using air concentrations
 Radiation dose factors from EPA Federal Guidance  Reports No. 11 and 12 are used.
 Radionuclide consequenses will be reported as cancer incidence risk.
 Chemical health impact endpoints are evaluated based on input 
   information in the Receptor Intake File (RIF) and the following selections.
   If the RIF file does not contain information for an endpoint, it is not calculated.
 Perform chemical impact analyses for non-carcinogenic effects
