<br>

<br>The Multimedia Environmental Pollutant Assessment
System (MEPAS) is a physics-based tool for simulating contaminant source
release, environmental transport and transformation, human exposure and
dose, and risk in a multimedia environmental system. In the environmental
scenarios that MEPAS can address, contamination can move through the environment
along several different transport pathways (i.e., vadose zone/groundwater
pathway, overland flow/surface water pathway, and atmospheric pathway).
MEPAS consists of a collection of linked computer modules (i.e., computer
codes for simulating one or more of the aforementioned processes) controlled
by a user-friendly interface. The material in this report is documentation
for the MEPAS Version 3.2 and the Remedial Action Assessment System (RAAS)
Version 1.1.

<br>

<br>The MEPAS source-term release module documented
in this report includes models for estimating contaminant loss from three
different types of source zones: contaminated aquifer, contaminated pond/surface
impoundment, and contaminated vadose zone. In all types of contaminant
source zones, it is assumed that the contaminants may be present in multiple
phases (i.e., in aqueous solution, sorbed to solid particles, in vapor-filled
pore space, or in a separate non-aqueous-phase liquid [NAPL] that is immiscible
with water and air). The source-term release module contains models to
determine which contaminants in the problem scenario will partition into
which phases, and to what degree. Depending on the type of source zone,
it is assumed that the processes causing contaminant release from the source
zone to an environmental transport pathway could be leaching (groundwater
pathway), wind suspension (atmospheric pathway), water erosion (overland/surface
water pathway), overland flow (overland/surface water pathway), and/or
volatilization (atmospheric pathway). In addition, contaminants could be
lost from the source zone by radioactive decay or degradation within the
zone.

<br>

<br>The source-term release module contains models
for simulating "baseline" (i.e., unremediated) scenarios for all three
types of source zones. These same models can be used to simulate remediated
sites (for all three types of source zones) if the remediation methodology
can be represented merely by changing the magnitude of certain model parameters
from their "baseline" values. In addition, for the vadose zone source zone,
the source-term release module contains models that can calculate loss
fluxes from vadose zones subjected to two types of remediation methodologies
that require special theory: <i>in situ</i> vitrification (ISV) and <i>in
situ</i> solidification (ISS).

<br>

<br>The ultimate objective of the source-term release
component of MEPAS is to calculate a "mass-budgeted" set of contaminant
flux versus time functions that describe the simultaneous loss of contaminants
from the source zone to a number of different routes. When multiple loss
processes are assumed to occur simultaneously, the mathematical models
implemented in the source-term release module account for their synergistic
or antagonistic interaction. "Mass-budgeted" means that the inventory of
each contaminant is apportioned to each loss route (by the implemented
physics-based theory) in a manner such that the sum of the calculated contaminant
losses to all routes is limited to 100% of the initial inventory.

<br>

<br>The source-term release module has been developed
to allow the user flexibility in how the contaminant release to different
routes is simulated. If the user wishes to explicitly enter the contaminant
flux to one or more loss routes (based on known or assumed data, or the
predictions of some other model), the source-term release component will
use the supplied flux versus time function(s) until mass balance considerations
dictate that the flux must go to zero (because cumulative contaminant mass
loss to all routes has removed 100% of the initial inventory). If the user
cannot or does not wish to supply explicit contaminant fluxes to any or
all loss routes, the source-term release component contains models that
will calculate the flux verses time functions (also according to mass balance
considerations). If the user wants to analyze a scenario that assumes contaminant
release to only a subset of the possible loss routes for a given type of
source zone, loss to undesired routes can be "turned off" by specifying
a known flux of zero to those routes.

<br>

<br>Section 2.0 of this report describes some basic
attributes of the source-term release module that are applicable to any
of the three types of contaminant source zones simulated by it. These include
discussions of contaminant phase partitioning theory and the general mathematical
approach to describing contaminant mass loss rates.

<br>

<br>Sections 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 give details of the
specific approaches for addressing contaminated aquifer, pond/surface impoundment,
and vadose zone source zones, respectively. Each of these sections contains
a description of: the conceptual model assumed for that source zone, the
mathematical models that lead to the contaminant flux expressions (if the
user allows MEPAS to compute the release functions), the numerical solution
procedure that produces a set of "mass-budgeted" release fluxes for each
contaminant, analytical solutions for certain special cases (i.e., simplified
scenarios) that could be used to verify the source-term release module
outputs, methods already implemented in the module for calculating certain
parameters in the contaminant flux expressions, and how to use user-supplied
flux versus time functions for one or more loss routes (if the user does
not want MEPAS to compute the release functions). The theory presented
for the contaminated aquifer and pond/surface impoundment source zones
is relatively straightforward because no synergistic or antagonistic interactions
between loss processes occur, and because the source zone dimensions remain
constant. On the other hand, the theory presented for the contaminated
vadose zone source zone is relatively complex because interactions between
loss processes do occur, and because the loss processes may cause the dimensions
of the source zone to change in several ways. Furthermore, auxiliary theory
implemented in the module to calculate selected parameters used in the
vadose zone mass loss equations is relatively extensive.

<br>

<br>Section 6.0 contains a brief summary of the module
and its current limitations, and a discussion of plans for further development.
Section 7.0 is a list of all symbols used in this report, along with their
definitions and their associated units. Section 8.0 lists all references
cited in the report. Finally, a complete listing of all the input parameters
required by the source-term release module, along with the necessary units,
is given in Appendix A.
