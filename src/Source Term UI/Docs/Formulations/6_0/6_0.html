<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A contaminant source-term release module has been
developed for MEPAS. This report documents the implementation of this computer
module for MEPAS Version 3.2 and RAAS Version 1.1. Contaminated aquifer,
pond/surface impoundment, and vadose zone source zones can be analyzed.
Contaminants can be present in aqueous, sorbed, vapor, or NAPL phases.
The module calculates the simultaneous contaminant fluxes (as functions
of time) to various loss routes (i.e., degradation/decay, leaching, wind
suspension, water erosion, overland flow, and/or volatilization) in a manner
that accounts for interactions between loss processes and conserves overall
mass. The outputs of the source-term release module are linked as inputs
to the environmental transport, and exposure/health impact modules of MEPAS.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The source-term release module can be used
to simulate "baseline" scenarios as well as scenarios where certain remediation
methodologies have been implemented at the site. Remediation methodologies
that can be simulated include all methodologies that can be represented
merely by changing the magnitude of certain model parameters, as well as
ISV and ISS methodologies in the vadose zone (which use different theory
implemented in the module).

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because a numerical solution scheme is
used to solve the differential equations of contaminant loss versus time,
certain environmental input parameters can be entered as time-varying quantities
rather than being constrained to constants. Analytical solutions that apply
to special cases are also presented in the report.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For certain simpler scenarios, the numerical
solution algorithms implemented in the module have been verified through
comparison with analytical solutions. Tests of the algorithms for calculating
loss to different routes have been conducted through applications of the
source-term module to specific problem scenarios. Additional testing is
in progress.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current version of the source-term
release module represents a consolidation and significant augmentation
of numerous source-term release capabilities that existed in different
modules of previous versions of MEPAS. However, it does not represent the
ultimate source-term release capability envisioned for this component.
The current version contains a number of idealizing assumptions and limitations.
The remainder of this section discusses these, and describes further development
plans envisioned for the module.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current version of the module associated
with RAAS Version 1.1 limits the contaminants that can be analyzed to those
that already exist in the associated RAAS contaminant property database.
In the future, the module may be modified to allow the user to analyze
contaminants not already in the database (without actually modifying the
database). In this event, values of all relevant contaminant-specific properties
would have to be supplied by the user. (The capability to edit the MEPAS
database already exists.)

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current version of the module determines
whether a contaminant is one that may partition into a NAPL phase by using
the database value of the modified (unitless) Henry's Law constant as a
test metric (i.e., NAPL phase contaminant if K<sub>Hi</sub> > 10<sup>-7</sup>).
This method makes appropriate determinations in most instances; but does
lead to errors in cases that include nonvolatile organic compounds (e.g.,
PCBs) or volatile radionuclides (e.g., tritium and iodine). In the future,
the module may be modified to include a new method to make this determination,
either using the database value of the octanol-water partition coefficient
as a test metric or (preferably) using the chemical's category number from
the chemical classification system currently built into the RAAS software.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current version of the module uses
a relatively complex, yet still simplified, method of determining aqueous
and vapor concentrations for a contaminant (at each time step) in systems
where a NAPL phase exists. In the future, the module may be modified to
include a full phase distribution model for this calculation (at each time
step), which means that all volumetric fluid contents (water, air, NAPL)
will be recalculated simultaneously with the contaminant phase partitioning.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This report presents analytical solutions
applicable to special cases; however, they are not currently implemented
in the module. In the future, these analytical solutions may be implemented
so that the user can directly verify or bypass numerical outputs of the
module.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idealized theory for volatilization from a pond/surface
impoundment source zone has been implemented in the module to act as a
bounding calculation for highly volatile compounds that tended to disappear
too quickly (with the 1-yr time step commonly used in simulations). However,
simulated volatilization rates for these compounds still seem high. In
the future, the module may be modified to correct this situation by either
adding a capability to vary the length of the time step automatically during
a simulation based on limits on the amount of mass that can be lost during
a time step, or by implementing improved models for volatilization for
the pond/surface impoundment source zone.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, previous versions of MEPAS included
the capability to analyze additional types of volatilization scenarios
beyond what are currently implemented in the module. In the future, the
module may be augmented to address these scenarios as well. These scenarios
are 1) a landfill without internal gas generation, 2) a landfill with internal
gas generation, 3) an aqueous pond/surface impoundment that contains a
layer of contaminated sediment at the bottom (which controls the volatilization
loss), and 4) a surface spill of liquid that is a NAPL-phase mixture.
