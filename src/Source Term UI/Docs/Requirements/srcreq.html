<p>The MEPAS Computed Source Term Release Module (CSTRM) is generally the
starting module for most analyses. It requires source inventories or concentrations
and uses site specific information to simulate the contaminant source releases,
outputs contaminant mass fluxes from the source, and provides input boundary
conditions to the other module types (exposure, vadose, aquifer, surface
water and air). This document contains the requirements for the MEPAS CSTRM
and can be used by software engineers and testers to ensure the module
functions properly. A test plan will be developed from this and the CSTRM
design report. Test cases will be developed from the test plan to ensure
that the product meets the needs of the client(s) and to establish a baseline
version of the module. The formulations for this module are provided in
Streile et al. (1996).
<p>
<b>2.0 Purpose of MEPAS Computed Source Term Release Module</b>
<p>The purpose of the MEPAS CSTRM is to calculate time-varying contaminant
mass fluxes from a source as a function of time. Both radionuclides and
chemicals are evaluated by the MEPAS CSTRM. These contaminant mass fluxes
are used to describe the loss of contaminant from the defined source zone
via loss routes to various environmental media (e.g., air, soil, and water).
<p>The loss routes in the MEPAS CSTRM are water leaching, volatilization,
wind suspension, overland runoff, and decay/degradation. These loss routes
can contaminate air, water, and soil in the environment around the source.
Common source types normally dealt with in hazardous waste site assessment
are landfills, buried waste, surface impoundments, surface storage, wastewater
outfalls, injection wells, vents/stacks, aquifers, rivers, and lakes/ponds.
The three generic source types in the MEPAS CSTRM are: aquifer, ponds/surface
impoundments, and surface/subsurface soil.
<p>
<b>3.0 Summary of Requirements for the MEPAS Computed Source Term Release
Module</b>
<p>This section provides an overall summary of the requirements for the
MEPAS CSTRM. Detailed input, output, and scientific requirements are described
in the section that follows.
<p>The MEPAS Computed CSTRM will

<ol>
<li>have a minimum of 25 contaminants to be evaluated</li>

<li>release contaminant from the waste zone to multiple transport pathways
via volatization, suspension, infiltration, overland runoff, and decay/degradation
loss routes</li>

<li>compute contaminant mass fluxes that provide mass balance for different
loss routes for each time step</li>

<b>4.0 Input Requirements for the MEPAS Computed Source Term Release Module</b>
<p>The user enters the input data required for the MEPAS CSTRM via the
module user interface (MUI). The MUI will allow the user to define the
source problem and associated data. The primary input types to the MEPAS
CSTRM are 1) initial contaminant mass or <u>concentration</u>, 2) source
physical characteristics, 3) identification of loss routes and 4) contaminant
properties.
<p>There are some general requirements associated with the MUI, which are

<ol>
<li>The graphical MUI will operate in Windows 95 and will have a standard Windows
95 look and feel.</li>

<li>The MUI will have on-line electronic help in HTML format that provides
users with easy-to-understand descripts of all input parameters required
by the MUI.</li>

<li>The MUI will provide users with different units for the appropriate input
parameters.</li>

<li>The MUI will also have an About tab to inform users of the title, version
number and general description of the module.</li>
</ol>

The MUI for the MEPAS CSTRM must allow the user to input all the required
data to execute the MEPAS CSTRM. This includes allowing the user to
<ol>
<li>select the environmental media and loss routes associated with the source</li>

<li>provide source characteristics associated with the environmental media
and loss routes selected</li>

<li>enter the initial mass or <u>concentration</u> data for each contaminant
being evaluated</li>

<li>enter key contaminant properties.</li>
</ol>

There are ten main data categories associated with the MEPAS CSTRM and
each of these categories have data entry requirements. The following data
are obtained from the MUI and are needed by the MEPAS CSTRM to perform
its computations.
<p>The first main data category is <b>Options</b>, which allow the user

</ol>

The following are the <b>Waste Zone</b> characterization data requested
of the user:

<li>thickness, width, and length of waste zone</li>

<li>bulk density, moisture content, and total porosity of the waste zone</li>

<li>latitude and elevation of the waste zone</li>

<li>Soil Conservation Service (SCS) curve number</li>

<li>top soil water capacity</li>

<li>annual number of days with 7.254 mm of precipitation.</li>
</ol>

The following are the <b>Monthly Climatology</b> data requested of the
user for each month of the year:

<ol>
<li>average temperature</li>

<li>average precipitation</li>

<li>average wind speed</li>

<li>average cloud cover</li>

<li>average number of precipitation</li>

<li>average minimum and maximum relative humidity.</li>
</ol>

The following are the <b>Known Media Release</b> data requested of the
user:

<ol>
<li>Darcy infiltration rate(s) and associated times</li>

<li>soil depth lost to water erosion rate(s) and associated times</li>

<li>wind erosion rate(s) and associated times.</li>
</ol>

The following are the <b>Contaminant Properties</b> data requested of the
user:

<li>contaminant water solubility limit</li>

<li>contaminant inventory or concentration</li>

<li>contaminant decay/degradation half life</li>

<li>faction of volatilization release for each contaminant.</li>
</ol>

The following are the <b>Known Contaminant Flux</b> data requested of the
user:

<ol>
<li>known contaminant leaching flux rate(s) and associated time</li>

<li>known contaminant overland flux rate(s) and associated time</li>

<li>known contaminant suspension flux rate(s) and associated time</li>

<li>known contaminant volatilization flux rate(s) and associated time</li>

<li>known contaminant source/sink flux rate(s) and associated time.</li>
</ol>

The <b>K<sub>d</sub> </b>data requested of the user includes contaminant-specific
K<sub>d</sub> and associated times. The MUI will provide an estimate of
the K<sub>d</sub> if the user selects this option.
<p>The following are the <b>Suspension</b> data requested of the user:

<ol>
<li>darcy bulk density and percent sand of the surface soil</li>

<li>fraction of surface crust and roughness length</li>

<li>fraction of crust and vegetation covering the soil surface</li>

<li>surface roughness and the number of disturbances per month of the area</li>

<li>annual maximum wind speed and Thornwaite's PEI value for the area</li>

<ol>
<li>storm types, slope, slope length, and rain intensity for the region</li>

<li>erosion, vegetation, and land practice factors.</li>
</ol>

Once the user enters this information, some intermediate calculations may
be required by the MUI to feed the necessary data to the MEPAS CSTRM. These
calculations are associated with the initial mass and the mass balance
analysis. The user will be allowed to

<ol>
<li>input user-defined contaminant mass fluxes that are inflows and outflows
from the source other than the source loss routes -&nbsp; These are known
as sources (inflow) and sinks (outflow) and are time varying. These external
sources and sinks must be considered with the initial mass associated with
the original source zone.</li>

<li>have either MEPAS CSTRM compute all contaminant mass fluxes or have the
MEPAS CSTRM compute contaminant mass fluxes for some loss routes.&nbsp;
The user can enter known contaminant mass fluxes for other loss routes.</li>
</ol>

Note that if all contaminant mass fluxes are known for all loss routes,
a different Source Term module must be used (FRAMES User-Defined Source
Module).
<p>The user is allowed to enter either user-defined water (infiltration
and overland) flow rates and soil (wind, mechanical, and overland) erosion
rates or have the module compute them based on source and environmental
setting data. The water infiltration flow rate is required for the leaching
loss route, the overland water flow rate for overland loss route, the soil
erosion rate related to wind and mechanical suspension, and overland runoff
loss routes.
<p>
<b>5.0 Output Requirements for the MEPAS Computed Source Term Release
Module</b>
<p>The MEPAS CSTRM is required to output time-varying instantaneous contaminant
mass fluxes for air, soil (deposition from air) and water. These outputs
must meet the specifications of the FRAMES (Whelan et al. 1997). The mass
flux of contaminant to the air must be provided in the *.AFF file and the
mass flux of contaminant to the water in the *.WFF file.
<p>The MEPAS CSTRM outputs the following data to the AFF, WFF, and SCF:

<ol>
<li>time-varying contaminant particle and gaseous emission rates (AFF)</li>

<li>time-varying contaminant infiltration and overland runoff flux rates (WFF)</li>

<li>time-varying infiltration, to the WFF.</li>

<li>time-varying wind erosion and erosion notes to the AFF.</li>
</ol>

Other output files that the MEPAS CSTRM is required to produce are the
SLS and ERR File:

<ol>
<li>create a list file (*.SLS) in an ASCII format that echoes the input data
and provides intermediate calculations and results.</li>

<li>create an Error (*.ERR) File in an ASCII format at the start of the module
execution.</li>
</ol>

<b>6.0 Scientific Requirements for the MEPAS Computed Source Term Release
