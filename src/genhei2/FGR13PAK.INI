Note: The first field of the above records is the file name within FGR13PAK,
the second is the full name of the file, include it's path (to be specified by
the user), and the third field, when nonzero, is the RECL specification in
FORTRAN's OPEN statement for direct access files.  For example, a record might
be

           'index.ndx',  'd:\FGR13\dcf\fgr13cof.ndx', 165

which indicates that the file denoted as 'index.ndx' in the FORTRAN source code
corresponds to 'd:\FGR13\dcf\fr13cof.ndx', where 'FGR\13\dcf' is a directory
on drive 'd:' within which the file 'fgr13cof.ndx' resides. The name of the
file and its location given in the second field of the record must not
exceed 64 characters. The fields are not case sensitive. The integer 165 in
the third field is the value of RECL in FORTRAN's OPEN statement. These values
are only of concern when recompiling the READEM or FGR13PAK. 

For Code Developers: FORTRAN compilers define RECL is different manners.  For
example, Microsoft and WATCOM the value of RECL does not include the carriage-
return and line-feed (2 bytes) which separate records in formatted direct 
access files. Both Lahey and Compaq/Digital include these two bytes in their
defination of RECL.  The above values of RECL do not include these 2 bytes.
