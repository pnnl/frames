Note: The first field is the file name in the software, the second is the
full name of the file, include it's path, and the third field gives the RECL
specification in the FORTRAN open statement if the file is to be opened as a
direct access file.  For example, the record

           'index.ndx',  'd:\pnl\dcf\fgr13cof.ndx', 165

indicates that the file denoted as 'index.ndx' in the software is assigned to
d:\pnl\dcf\fr13cof.ndx, where "pnl\dcf" is the directory, on drive d: within 
which the index file fgr13cof.ndx resides.  The length of the second field, 
specifing the index file, can not exceed 64 characters.  The integer 165 is 
the value of RECL in the statement opening the file. Note: FORTRAN compilers
may define RECL is different manners.  For example, Microsoft does not include
in RECL, the carriage-return and line-feed (2 bytes) which separate records in 
formatted direct access files. However, Lahey includes these two bytes in their 
specification of RECL.  The numerical values of RECL listed abouve are for
Microsoft FORTRAN; for use with a Lahey compiler add two to the values.
