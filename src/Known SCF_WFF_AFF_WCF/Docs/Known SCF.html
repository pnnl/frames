<br>
<p>Use this module only if you know the constituent concentrations in soil.&nbsp; The constituent concentrations at user provided points in time are entered directly through the interface.&nbsp; This module does not compute the ingrowth of progeny because the user is assumed to know everything about the source, including progeny concentrations.&nbsp; Therefore, this module assumes that the progeny emissions will be input along with the parent concentrations.
<p>The concentrations are a spacial average throughout the volume of soil.&nbsp; The concentrations are in pCi/kg or g/kg depending on whether the constituent is a radionuclide or chemical.&nbsp; These concentration values are the instantaneous values at that time, not an average.&nbsp; There are NO limits on the number of constituents or progeny.
<p>For more information about the file specification that this module produces see <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/soil-concentration-file-scf">SCF Specifications</a> on the <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/earth/frames-v1">FRAMES</a> web site.
<p><b>SCF Boundary Condition Parameters</b><a NAME="transmit"></a>
<p><b><i>Width of contaminated soil</i></b><a NAME="one"></a>
<br>Units: m (meters)
<br>Range: Greater than 0.
<p>Enter the width of the region of contaminated soil.&nbsp; The direction of the width is arbitrary.
<p><b><i>Length of contaminated soil</i></b><a NAME="two"></a>
<br>Units: m (meters)
<br>Range: Greater than 0.
<p>Enter the length of the region of contaminated soil.&nbsp; The direction of the length is arbitrary.
<p><b><i>Depth of contaminated soil</i></b><a NAME="three"></a>
<br>Units: m (meters)
<br>Range: Greater than 0.
<p>Enter the thickness of the region of contaminated soil.
<p><b><i>Constituent</i></b><a NAME="parent"></a>
<br>The list of constituents is identified by a 'Constituent' database module.&nbsp; Each of the constituents selected for analysis in the 'Constituent' module appears in this drop-down box.&nbsp; Use the drop down-box or the « » buttons to make differeent constituent selections.&nbsp; As a new selection is made the spreadsheet closest to the drop-down box is updated with the appropriate time series.&nbsp; If the selected constituent has progeny and if the "Include Progeny" option is checked under the "Options" menu, then an identical set of controls will appear to the left of the parent.&nbsp; The progeny will be displayed as the parent is displayed but only those progeny that relate to the displayed parent are available for data entry.
<p><b><i>Time</i></b></a><a NAME="constituent"></a>
<br>Units: yr (years)
<br>Range: Greater than or equal to 0.
<p>A minimum of two times must be entered.&nbsp; Times must be entered in chronological, ascending order (i.e., 0, 5, 10 not 0, 10, 5).&nbsp; The spreadsheet rows must be used consecutively.&nbsp; Anything below a skipped time row will be deleted.&nbsp; A point in time at which a measurement/estimate is given should be relative to all other times entered in the interface and the overall simulation.
<p><b><i>Concentration</i></b>
<br>Units: g/kg (grams constituent per kilogram dry soil) or pCi/kg (picocuries constituent per kilogram dry soil)
<br>Range: Greater than or equal to 0.
<p>Enter the soil concentrations over time.&nbsp; Items left blank in rows that have a valid time defined are filled with zeros. All rows after and including the first row with an invalid time are ignored and cleared.
