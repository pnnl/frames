<center><h1>RIF Receptor Intakes Module Help</h1><a NAME="top"></a></center>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>
<p>Use this module only if you know the receptor constituent intakes for the human populations.&nbsp; The constituent intake rates, at user provided points in time and media, are entered directly through the interface.&nbsp; This module does not compute the ingrowth of progeny because the user is assumed to know everything about the source, including progeny intakes.&nbsp; Therefore, this module assumes that the progeny intakes are input along with the parent intakes.
<p>For more information about the file specification that this module produces see <a href="http://mepas.pnl.gov/FRAMESV1/rif.html">RIF Specifications</a> on the <a href="http://mepas.pnl.gov/FRAMESV1">FRAMES</a> web site.
<p><b><i>Medium</i></b><a NAME="medium"></a>
<br>Choose one or more medium types i.e. Air, Aquifer, Surface Water, Wetlands, Soil. Selected medium types will be highlighted.&nbsp; To remove a selection, click on the highlighted medium type.

<p><b><i>Exposure Characterization</i></b><a NAME="medium"></a>
<br>Select Acute or Chronic depending on the time period of exposure to the constituent.&nbsp; If the exposure is over a period of less than a year, select Acute.&nbsp; If the effect of an exposure is being assessed over a long term period, i.e. over a period of several years, select Chronic.
<p><b><i>Coordinates</i></b><a NAME="coordinates"></a>
<br>Units: km (kilometers).
<br>Range: Greater than 0.
<p>Enter the relative coordinate location where the receptor was exposed to the constituent(s).&nbsp; A minimum of one set of coordinates of locations of potential exposure points is required for the matrix to be generated.&nbsp; A relative coordinate is a location coordinate that is relative to all other coordinates in the simulation.&nbsp; All coordinates in a simulation are expected to be relative.

<p><b><i>Age Group</i></b><a NAME="age"></a>
<br>Units: yr (years)
<br>Range: Greater than 0
<p>Select as many age groups as desired by clicking on Add button.&nbsp; Define the range of each age group by entering the starting and ending age. At least one age group must be defined.&nbsp; A particular age group can be deleted by highlighting it and clicking on the Remove button.

<p><b><i>Time and Duration</i></b><a NAME="time"></a>
<br>Units: yr (year)
<br>Range: Greater than 0
<p>When a age group is selected, a tree view of the constituents to which the receptors were exposed, will be displayed.&nbsp; Click on each constituent in the tree view under this node to enter the times and duration at which the receptor intakes were measured for this age group.&nbsp; Time is the point of occurrence of potential exposure.&nbsp; Duration is the window of time period for which the exposure assessment is being forecast.&nbsp; It is recommended that the duration be constant over time, but not required.&nbsp; A minimum of two times must be entered.&nbsp; Times must be entered in chronological, ascending order (i.e., 0, 5, 10 not 0, 10, 5).&nbsp; The spreadsheet rows must be used consecutively.&nbsp; Anything below a skipped time row will be deleted.&nbsp; A point in time at which a measurement/estimate is given should be relative to all other times entered in the interface and the overall simulation.
<p>The check boxes at the bottom right of the figure below tell the interface to create carcenogenic and/or non-carcenogenic effect types available for chemicals when a pathway is selected.&nbsp;  These checkboxes do not appear for radionuclides as radionuclude currently have only one effect type.&nbsp; Click on the desired checkbox to indicate use.

<p><b><i>Constituent</i></b><a NAME="pathway"></a>
<br>Choose the pathways through which the receptor is exposed to the constituent.&nbsp; There are four major constituent pathways - Ingestion, Inhalation, Dermal and External.&nbsp; Ingestion is the process through which the constituent would have been swallowed by the receptor.&nbsp; Inhalation involves the receptor breathing the constituent into the body.&nbsp; Dermal is when the receptor's skin comes in contact with the constituent and&nbsp; External pathway encompasses the receptor being exposed to the constituent without it actually entering the body of the receptor.&nbsp; The selection of External pathway is available only for radionuclides and all media except Aquifer.
<p>The selected pathways will be highlighted.&nbsp; Additional pathways can be added by clicking on the exposure route buttons labeled Ingestion, Inhalation, Dermal and External above each list.&nbsp; The newly added pathways will be recognized by other modules only when it is supported by the existing modules.  Although a module really shouldn't need to know the pathway label in as much as all the information needed to calculate risk other than the risk factors are supplied here.

<b><i>Type</i></b><a NAME="type"></a>
<br>Units: None
<br>Range: None
<p>The type of effect, i.e. carcinogenic, non-carcinogenic or intake, the constituent could have on the receptor is displayed in this window. The display varies depending on the constituent. The user cannot select the type of effect.
<p><b><i>Population</i></b><a NAME="population"></a>
<br>Units: None
<br>Range: None
<p>The number displayed in this window depends on how many age groups were entered.&nbsp; If three sets of age groups were selected for analysis, the number displayed in this window will be 3.&nbsp; As at least one age group must be selected for the module to run, the minimum number displyed in this window will be 1.
<p><b><i>Concentrations</i></b><a NAME="concentrations"></a>
<br>Units: Varies depending on the medium type in use.
<br>Range: Greater than 0.
<p>Enter the concentration of the constituent at each given time and location.&nbsp; Repeat this for all media, age-group, constituent and selected pathways, combination.
