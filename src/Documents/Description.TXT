The Description file is the mechanism that informs the
FUI how to run a module.  It is a simple format and is
used to describe the model.   The text string, at the
bottom of the file  will include the following
information:

A description of what the model is typically used for
any limiting assumptions such as on dose radionuclides,
can only do 20 constituents at a time)
- Typical time scale of runs
- Reference to formulation documents
- Reference to verification documents if they exist
- Reference to validation documents if they exist
- Hardware requirements
- Contact point for question regarding the model

MODULE VERSION
1.2

MODULE DESCRIPTION
FRAMES Known Surface Water Module

Use this module only if you know the
concentrations and/or fluxes in the surface water.
The chemical concentrations/fluxes are entered
directly through the interface.

DECAY PRODUCTS
This module does not compute the ingrowth of progeny
because the user is assumed to know everything about the
source, including progeny emission.  Therefore, this module
assumes that the progeny emissions are input along with the
parent emissions.
