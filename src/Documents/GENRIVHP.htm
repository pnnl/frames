<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=start></a>The GENII surface water component allows
the user to define the type of water body being modeled and necessary
parameters for the selected type.  Two types of models are included: dilution 
models for rivers and lakes, and recirculation models for impoundments.
The impoundment models are optional - they may be used to modify the amount
ultimately released to the receiving river or lake.</p>

<p><a name=GNSWType></a>Select the surface water type representative of the
transport being evaluated.&nbsp; The current surface water dilution types are: acute
river, chronic river, chronic flow dilution (river), and near-shore <span
class=GramE>lake</span>.&nbsp; Click on the down arrow to see and select from
the list of types. </p>

<p><a name=GNSWTREL></a>Enter the duration of the release to the surface water
body and select the correct units.&nbsp; Note that the calculated water
concentration is assumed to be released uniformly over this period, with zero
concentration after the end of the release. </p>

<p><a name=GNSWEXPNAME></a>Select the exposure location associated with the
surface water transport analysis.&nbsp; The locations shown are those currently
defined and connected to this surface water transport glyph.&nbsp; If more that
one exposure location is available (click on the down arrow to see the list of
available locations), then information for all locations should be defined
before saving and exiting the user interface. </p>

<p><a name=GNSWTT></a>Enter the time required for transport of water from the
source to the exposure location and select the correct units.&nbsp; Note that
decay and progeny radionuclide <span class=SpellE>ingrowth</span> is calculated
for this period of time and included in the calculated water concentrations at
the exposure location. </p>

<p><a name=GNSWZDEP></a>Enter the depth of the usage intake point in the
near-shore lake environment and select the correct units.&nbsp; This parameter
is used only for the near-shore lake model. </p>

<p><a name=GNSWDSCHG></a>Enter the total volumetric discharge rate of the river
at the exposure location and select the correct units.&nbsp; This is the
dilution volume per time use to estimate the water concentration.&nbsp; This
parameter is used only for the acute river model and the chronic flow dilution
model. </p>

<p><a name=GNSWVELOC></a>Enter the average flow velocity for the river or
near-shore lake current and select the correct units.&nbsp; The models assume
that the flow velocity is constant between the source and exposure location. </p>

<p><a name=GNSWLSX></a>Enter the distance of flow between the source and the
exposure location and the correct units.&nbsp; This parameter is used for the
chronic river and the near-shore lake models. </p>

<p><a name=GNSWOSY></a>Enter the perpendicular distance from the shoreline to
the water intake port at the exposure location, and select the correct
units.&nbsp; This parameter (offshore distance) is use for the chronic river
and the near-shore lake models.&nbsp; The value entered for the offshore
distance for the river model must be less than or equal to the value <span
class=GramE>entered</span> for the river width. </p>

<p><a name=GNSWDPTH></a>Enter the average depth of the river or near-shore lake
flow path between the source and the exposure location, and select the correct
units. </p>

<p><a name=GNSWIDTH></a>Enter the average width of the river between the source
and the exposure location, and select the correct units. <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p>The impoundment models include plug-flow, fully-mixed, and partially-mixed ponds.
The plug flow pond receives the plant effluent and in turn discharges it to a larger 
body of receiving water.  The water does not recirculate back to the plant once it 
is discharged.  Plug flow ponds are usually narrow and well-diked, forcing the plant 
effluent to travel a well-defined path from the plant discharge point to the point 
of outfall from the pond.  Note, that for a pond of this nature, the travel time t 
from plant outfall to pond outlet is t = V / qb, where V is the volume of the pond 
and qb is the reactor discharge rate = the pond outflow rate.<p>

<p>The fully-mixed pond model simulates a closed cycle pond where full mixing occurs 
throughout the effective volume of the pond.  Fresh make-up water is fed in to 
replace the water lost by evaporation or outflow.  The plant effluent is assumed 
to mix instantaneously and completely with the entire volume of the pond.  To ensure 
fully mixed conditions, the pond water is assumed to recirculate back into the plant 
at a much greater rate than the net flow through the pond. The pond approaches an
equilibrium condition; the years of operation allows the user to approach this condition.<p>

<p>The partially mixed pond model more closely resembles real ponds and represents 
an intermediate scheme between the extremes of the completely mixed and plug flow 
models.  The partially mixed pond model treats ponds where the plant pumping rate 
and the outflow rate are of similar importance.  The model assumes that the 
discharged effluent mixes completely with the water inflow at the instant of 
discharge from the plant, after which the diluted plug moves through the pond without 
mixing, with the resultant concentration affected solely by radioactive decay.  Then 
the concentration at the plant inlet is added to the radioactivity discharged from 
the plant as the coolant water cycles through.<p>
