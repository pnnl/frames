<b>NOTE: Local meteorological data are required by the MEPAS air dispersion model
to compute patterns of air and soil concentrations. Those data should be
from the nearest meteorological observation station that will have weather
conditions that are most representative of the area to be modeled.
In United States, the Environmental Data Service, NOAA, National Climatic
Center (NCC) in Asheville, North Carolina is the major supplier of such data.
Alternatively other agencies and organizations supply summaries of meteorological data.</b>

<h2>CLIMATOLOGY TAB</h2>

<a name="ACLCDREF"></a><u><b>AC-LCDREF</b>--Reference weather station</u>
<br />Units: none
<br />
<br />An annual summary of the Local Climatological Data (LCD)
for the nearest representative national weather service station should
be obtained. They are published by the Environmental Data Service,
NOAA, National Climatic Center (NCC) in Asheville, North Carolina.
Example LCD summaries are provided as <a href="FIG_2_32.HTM">Figures 2.32</a>,
<a href="FIG_2_33.HTM">2.33</a>, and <a href="FIG_2_34.HTM">2.34</a>.
The specific form of the LCD summary may differ from these examples, but
all of the information should be found under equivalent headings.
<br />
<br />In the United States, NOAA has assigned a five digit “Surface Station Number”
to each location where meteorological surface observations are available.
Enter the “Surface Station Number” or other appropriate identifier.
<br />
<br />Note: If “Joint Frequency Data (JFD)” is loaded later from a file,
the identifier will be set to the JFD station name and may be need
to be reset if the LCD data are not from the same station as the
JFD come from a different station.

if available. Otherwise, use <a href="FIG_3_2.HTM">Figure 3.2</a>
to estimate this value for sites in the contiguous United States.
Multiply the average morning mixing height for the facility from <a href="FIG_3_2.HTM">Figure
3.2</a> by 100 and enter the value on the worksheet. A common range
of values is from 1,000 to 2,600 m.
<br />
<br /><a name="ACRAIN"></a><u><b>AC-RAIN</b>--Annual precipitation</u>
<br />Units: inches (in.)
<br />Range: 0.1 to 130.0
<br />
<br />Source of these data is the LCD summary (see Section
<a href="#ACLCDREF">AC-LCDREF</a>). Use the section entitled "Normals,
Means, and Extremes" to obtain the average annual total, water equivalent
precipitation.
<br />
<br /><a name="ACPRENUM"></a><u><b>AC-PRENUM</b>--Precipitation days per year</u>
<br />Units: number per year (#/yr)
<br />Range: 0 to 365
<br />
<br />Source of these data is the LCD summary (see Section
<a href="#ACLCDREF">AC-LCDREF</a>). A precipitation day is defined
as a day having at least 0.01 inch of precipitation. Obtain the annual
number of precipitation days from the LCD summary table (see <a href="FIG_2_33.HTM">Figure
2.33</a>). This value is found under the heading of "Mean number
of days: Precipitation 0.01 inches or more."
<br />
<br /><a name="ACNUMTS"></a><u><b>AC-NUMTS</b>--Thunderstorms per year</u>
<br />Units: number per year (#/yr)
<br />Range: 1 to 150
<br />
<br />Source of these data is the LCD summary (see Section
<a href="#ACLCDREF">AC-LCDREF</a>). Enter the number of days per
year having thunderstorms as listed in the LCD. This parameter is
defined as the number of days that thunder was heard at the station in
1 year.

<br />
<br />
<h2>JOINT FREQUENCY DATA TAB</h2>

<a name="AJFD"></a>Wind joint frequency data consist of tables of values
that give the relative frequencies of various wind conditions. A
joint frequency table for various wind speed groups, wind direction sectors,
and atmospheric stability classes (based on Pasquill stability categories)
is needed to represent the region surrounding the facility. These
data are used to characterize the annual patterns of atmospheric transport
and dispersion processes for the facility.
<br />
<br />A sample wind joint frequency summary is provided in
<a href="TAB_3_1.HTM">Table 3.1</a> (for wind stability classes A through
E). This sample summary illustrates one format for a joint frequency
distribution. Other formats can be equally useful although the parameters
may be listed in a different order. Also, the frequency values in
these tables may be expressed in a number of ways; e.g., as fractions,
percentages, or number of occurrences. <a href="TAB_3_1.HTM">Table
3.1</a> illustrates frequency values as number of occurrences. The
following provides guidance on the selection of data and subsequent entry
into the template table.
<br />
<br /><a href="FIG_3_5.HTM">Figure 3.5</a> illustrates the number
of occurrences of winds for 16 wind directions. The diagram is based
on information obtained at the National Weather Service station in Providence,
R.I. The plot represents the total number of occurrences (for all
wind-speed classes and wind-direction sectors) for stability class E.
These data correspond to the fifth page of <a href="TAB_3_1.HTM">Table
3.1</a> under the column "Total."
<br />
<br />There are normally two sources of these data. The first
source is joint frequency summaries from special meteorological stations
located at or in the immediate area of the facility. Facility environmental
statements, safety analysis documents, RCRA Part B Permit Applications,
and similar publications often contain such data when available.
The second source is STAR PROGRAM summaries from the National Climatic
Data Center (NCDC) in Asheville, North Carolina, which is operated by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA's) Environmental
Data Service (<a href="FIG_3_6.HTM">Figure 3.6</a>). The facility
documents may also contain summaries from this source.
<br />
<br />If the summaries are not found in the facility documents,
contact the NCDC concerning the summaries that are available or that could
be generated for this facility. The NCDC can provide a listing of
the locations for which summaries have been generated, and summaries can
be obtained for the cost of copying. In addition, the NCDC can generate
new summaries for first-order weather stations for a modest fee.
<br />
<br />Normally, the preferred data summary is from the station
closest to the facility. Special considerations such as data quality
or local influences on atmospheric transport and dispersion, may dictate
the selection of a summary from some station other than the closest.
In such a case, note the source of information and the reason.
<br />
<br />When otherwise equivalent summaries are available for
multiple measurement heights, use the data from the height closest to the
releast height of constituents.
<br />
<br />If summaries are available over different time periods,
give preference to the summary based on the longer time period (i.e., a
5-year summary is preferable to a 1-year summary). The minimum time
period for a summary is 1 year, and all observations each day at a station
should be taken into account.
<br />
<br />There are two situations in which it may be appropriate
to attach more than one summary for the facility:
<blockquote>
1. The release sites are geographically separated,
and joint frequency summaries are available for the different locations.
<br />2. The release sites are in complex terrain, and the local
winds are expected to be significantly different from the regional winds.
</blockquote>
<a name="AJSTATNM"></a><u><b>AJ-STATNM</b>--Data station</u>
<br />Units: none
<br />
<br />Enter a name that describes the location at which the
joint frequency data were taken. Use a descriptive name to designate
the location where onsite data were taken. For the NCDC data, enter
the name of the climatic station (normally the name of a nearby city).
Also enter the name of the state in which the station is located.
Document the source of the joint frequency summary data.
<br />
<br /><a name="AJANEMHT"></a><u><b>AJ-ANEMHT</b>--Anemometer height</u>
<br />Units: meters (m)
<br />Range: 0.0 to 999.9
<br />Typical environmental range: 3 to 15
<br />
<br />The height at which the winds were measured for the joint
frequency distribution can normally be obtained either from the source
of the joint frequency data (i.e., facility documentation for onsite data)
or from the last page of the LCD summary for NCDC data. The typical
value for joint frequency anemometer height is 3 m. This parameter
is critical only for data sets obtained from towers; 3 m will be adequate
for most near-surface data.
<br />
<br /><a name="AJRLEN"></a><u><b>AJ-RLEN</b>--Average roughness length</u>
<br />Units: centimeters (cm)
<br />Range: 0.0 to 999.9
<br />Typical environmental range: 0 to 150
<br />
<br />Estimate an average roughness length for the area surrounding
the weather station used for the wind joint frequency summary. The
typical value for roughness length is 10 cm.
<br />
<br /><a name="AJWINDS"></a><u><b>AJ-WINDS(6)</b>--Wind speed midpoints</u>
<br />Units: meters per second (m/s)
<br />Range: 0.00 to 99.99
<br />Typical environmental range: 1.0 to 10.0
<br />
<br />Midpoint wind speed values of the six wind-speed categories
are needed. If ranges of wind speeds are given in the summaries,
enter the ranges in the template and compute the midpoint by averaging
the two range values. If the midpoints are given in the summary, enter
these in the "Reported Midpoint" column (and ignore the "Range" columns).
If the category has no defined range as in the last category shown in <a href="TAB_3_2.HTM">Table
3.2</a> (>21 KTS), use the defining value as the midpoint.
<br />
<br />Combination of the values in the data tables is required
for more than six wind-speed groups. If combination is required,
combine the wind-speed categories so that the coverage of the range of
wind-speed conditions is as even as possible. The frequency of occurrence
of conditions within wind-speed groups will provide some guidance as to
which adjacent groups to combine--groups already having high frequencies
are generally left separate, and groups with relatively low frequencies
are combined.
<br />
<br />If fewer than six wind-speed groups are encountered, enter
the information for all available wind-speed groups. Enter a value
of 0 for the undefined wind-speed group midpoints.
<br />
<br /><a name="AJCALMS"></a><u><b>AJ-CALMS</b>--Wind joint frequency calms</u>
<br />Units: number, percent, or fraction
<br />
<br />Enter total frequencies of calm conditions and the units.
If no value is given for calms, enter a value of zero. The units
selected also determine the units for all the joint frequency data in the
stability class tabs (Class A through Class G).
<br />
<br /><a name="AJJFNAME"></a><u>Import Joint Frequency Data</u>
<br />Units: none
<br />
<br />If you wish to use joint frequency
data in an externally created joint-frequency data file, click on the "Import
Joint Frequency Data" button and select the file containing the data.
 An externally prepared data file should be given an extension of ".JFD" and have the
following format. The first line of the file is used to define two
variables, ORD and FRM, which are numeric and character variables, respectively.
FORTRAN formats are used to specify data input formats. This file
has the following structure:
<br />
<br />
<table border=1>
<tr>
<th><u>Line Number</u>
<th><u>Contents</u>
<th><u>Format of Data</u>
<tr>
<td>1
<td>ORD, FRM
<td>FORMAT(I1,A30)
<tr>
<td>2 to (N+1)
<td>N Lines of Joint Frequency Date
<td>FRM from Line 1
<tr>
<td>N+2 to N+3
<td>2 Lines of Calm Frequency Data
<td>FRM from Line 1
<tr>
<td>N+4
<td>Wind Speed Mid-Points (m/s)
<td>FRM from Line 1
</table>

<br />
<br />where ORD is always equal to 6. FRM is the FORTRAN
expression enclosed in parenthesis for reading
subsequent data. A typical format to enter fractions of
occurrences has the form of (F10.6). ORD equal to "6." indicates a
structure of six columns (wind-speed categories) per line and 16
lines (wind direction clockwise starting with North) per stability
class block. Alternative options for the value of ORD are no
longer supported. The joint frequency data are listed as blocks of
data for each stability class starting with the most unstable case
(A stability) and ending with the most stable case (G stability).
<br />
<br />The next two lines of the file contain
frequency of calm conditions for each stability class.
The last line contains the mid-points of the wind speed groups
used in generating the joint frequency table.
The following is an example JFD file:

<br />
<br /><a name="AJFDATA"></a><u>Joint Frequency Data</u>
<br />Units: number, percent or fraction of observations
<br />
<br />Input the data in the joint frequency table using the
same units as was specified for <a href="#AJCALMS">AJ-CALMS</a>.
The following guidelines should be used:
<blockquote>
1. Entries are limited to five significant digits including
the decimal point. The use and placement of the decimal point depends
on the form of the data:
<ul>
<li> Fractions of total time (table sum will equal 1.0)
are entered as thousandths; e.g., 0.0013, 0.0232, 0.0000.</li>
<li> Percentages of total time (table sum will equal 100.)
are entered as hundredths of percent; e.g., 00.13, 02.32, and 00.00.</li>
<li> Number of occurrences [table sum is 8760 for one
non-leap year of hourly observations (24 x 365)] are
expressed as whole numbers; e.g., 11.,2.,0., and so on.</li>
</ul>
<br />2. If frequencies are reported for an "unknown" or other
undefined category, the entries may be ignored. The model will automatically
adjust the input table to account for missing values. Data sets from
which more than 15% is missing should normally not be used.
<br />
<br />3. The table allows seven stability categories to be input.
If only the first six stability categories are provided, enter the available
data along with zeros for the seventh stability class. If some other
combination of six or fewer stability categories are encountered, enter
the data in the appropriate sections of the table with zeros entered for
missing data. If only wind direction and wind-speed information are
available, enter those data in the fourth stability category (D).
<br />
<br />4. The table has room for up to six wind-speed groups,
as defined in <a href="#AJWINDS">AJ-WINDS</a>. If fewer than six
groups are encountered, enter zeros for the frequencies in the undefined groups.
<br />
<br />5. Do not record summary, total, and average values in the table.

<h2>TOPOGRAPHICAL DATA TAB</h2>

<a name="ARTOPTYP"></a><u><b>AR-TOPTYP</b>--Use regional topographical data</u>
<br />Units: none
<br />
<br />AR-TOPTYP indicates whether or not
terrain heights will be needed for input. If this option is checked, the
influence of the local terrain will be considered. This option should
only be used in cases with an elevated plume released from a point source
and non-flat terrain occurs for distances within a 25 km radius of the
source. For a point source release, checking this box will result
in activation of the "Terrain Heights" tab, which requires entry of the
regional distribution of terrain heights (<a href="#ARTOPHTS">AR-TOPHTS</a>)used
to evaluate the intersection of elevated plumes with terrain. For
other cases (with a ground level release and/or flat terrain), this option
should not be used.
<br />
<br /><a name="ARTOPBAS"></a><u><b>AR-TOPBAS</b>--Elevation of release site</u>
<br />Units: meters (m)
<br />Range: -50 to 8840
<br />
<br />The elevation of the release site corresponding to inputs
of <a href="#ARTOPHTS">AR-TOPHTS</a> is required if the "Use regional topographical
data" box is checked. The source of this data is a topographic map.
<br />
<br /><a name="ARREGSUR"></a><u><b>AR-REGSUR</b>--Regional surface roughness lengths (z<sub>o</sub>'s)</u>
<br />Units: centimeters (cm)
<br />Range: 0.0 to 999.9
<br />Typical environmental range: 0 to 150
<br />
<br />Roughness lengths (z<sub>o</sub>'s) are needed for the
region surrounding the facility. A roughness length characterizes
the sizes of surface elements that can influence atmospheric dispersion
processes. Roughness lengths must be defined
for eight direction sectors at four predetermined distances from the facility.
<br />
<br /><a href="FIG_3_7.HTM">Figure 3.7</a> illustrates how surface
roughness affects the wind profile using three different environments.
The vertical wind profile at the left in Figure 3.7 is for bare ground.
The z<sub>o</sub> represents surface roughness. For bare ground the
z<sub>o</sub> is small (z<sub>o</sub> = 1 cm). The middle wind profile
is for an area with residential housing. These buildings increase
the surface resistance to the wind (z<sub>o</sub> = 10 cm) and reduce the
wind speed. This reduction of wind speed occurs up into the boundary
layer. Over a forest, the z<sub>o</sub> is 50 cm, which results in
a further reduction in wind speeds in the lower portion of the boundary
layer.
<br />
<br />An order-of-magnitude definition of average roughness
lengths will be sufficient. The roughness values reflect major differences
in surface cover. <a href="FIG_3_8.HTM">Figure 3.8</a> provides a
summary of typical roughness heights associated with various types of surface.
Using the information obtained in Section 1.0 along with facility photographs
and other descriptive material, compute an average roughness length.
For example, if one segment is about 50% agricultural (10 cm) and 50% low
forest (50 cm), assign it a value of 30 cm. If
the surface cover in a segment is completely unknown, enter a typical value
for grasslands as 10.
<br />
<br />If the surface cover in a segment is predominantly water,
enter a surface roughness of 0 cm in the table. For a zero input
value, the model computes the roughness of the surface as a function of
wind speed and stability. The roughness over water should only be
used in cases that require a spatial averaging of roughness values, i.e.,
for a segment containing significant fractions of both land and water surfaces.
The procedure for defining roughness lengths requires that the directions
and distances be overlaid on a map of the region surrounding the facility.
Map(s) are needed to cover the region out to a radius of about 75 km (approximately
50 mi). For the shortest distances, facility photographs, maps, and descriptions
will be most useful in defining roughness lengths. <a href="TAB_3_3.HTM">Table
3.3</a> shows the ranges of distances to be considered for each entry.
<a href="FIG_3_9.HTM">Figure 3.9</a> illustrates a typical grid layout
for determining the average roughness length for each direction and distance.
<br />
<br /><a name="ARTOPHTS"></a><u><b>AR-TOPHTS</b>--Regional distribution of terrain heights</u>
<br />Units: meters (m)
<br />Range: -50 to 8840
<br />
<br />The source of these data is a topographic map. A
circular grid with a 25-km radius centered on the release site is plotted
or overlain on the topographic map(s). This circular grid is defined
by dividing the area into 16 direction sectors (N, NNE, NE, etc.).
Each of these sectors is divided into annular segments by circles with
radii of 3, 10, and 25 km. For the thus-defined annular segments,
the maximum height of the topography for each segment is found by inspection
and entered as the terrain height value relative to the AR-TOPBAS value. There should be 64 terrain
height values entered.
