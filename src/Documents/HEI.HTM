<b>NOTE: The user must be aware that risk and health impact result values
of zero in the HIF file, placed there by the MEPAS Human Health Impact Module,
could mean several different things depending on the constituents and options
chosen. It could mean that
<blockquote>1) the risk or health impact
from the constituent is actually zero, meaning that the intake of the constituent
was zero;
<br />2) the chemical constituent is not a carcinogen and therefore
a risk value of zero was reported;
<br />3) the chemical constituent is only
a carcinogen and therefore a hazard quotient of zero was reported;
<br />4) the
hazard quotient of the chemical is non-zero but is lower than the user-defined
hazard index cutoff number; or
<br />5) there is no IRIS or HEAST toxicity value
for the chemical and the user has opted not to use values from other sources.
When zeroes are found, the user should check the constituent data in the
HLS file and review the input data and choices made in order to interpret
the true meaning.</b>

<a name="CHEMICAL"></a><h2>CHEMICAL TAB</h2>

<a name="CHEMRISK"></a><u><b>CHEMRISK</b>--Calculate lifetime cancer incidence</u>
<br />Range: On or Off
<br />
<br />This parameter controls whether or not lifetime cancer
incidence will be computed for each chemical constituent. The box should
be checked to indicate that cancer incidence results are a desired output
result and left unchecked if cancer incidence results are not a desired
output.
<br />
<br /><a name="CHEMLIM"></a><u><b>CHEMLIM</b>--Cancer incidence threshold limit</u>
<br />Units: none
<br />Range: 0.0 to 1.0
<br />
<br />This parameter is used to specify a lower cancer incidence
reporting limit. Cancer incidence results computed by the model that are
below the specified threshold limit will be reported as 0.0 in the HIF
file. For this reason, the user should be careful to examine CI results
when 0.0 values are reported. The 0.0 could indicate that there is no intake
for the exposure route or that the CI computed is lower than the threshold
limit.
<br />
<br /><a name="CHEMHI"></a><u><b>CHEMHI</b>--Calculate hazard index</u>
<br />Range: On or Off
<br />
<br />This parameter controls whether or not a hazard index
will be computed for each chemical constituent. The box should be checked
to indicate that hazard index results are a desired output result and left
unchecked if hazard index results are not a desired output.
<br />
<br /><a name="RFDLIM"></a><u><b>RFDLIM</b>--Hazard quotient threshold limit</u>
<br />Units: none
<br />Range: 0.0 to 100.0
<br />
<br />This parameter is used to specify a lower hazard quotient
reporting limit. Hazard quotient results computed by the model that are
below the specified threshold limit will be reported as 0.0 in the HIF
file. For this reason, the user should be careful to examine HI results
when 0.0 values are reported. The 0.0 could indicate that there is no intake
for the exposure route or that the HI computed is lower than the threshold
limit.
<br />
<br /><a name="CETOXT"></a><u><b>CE-TOXT</b>--Toxicity data for chemical effects</u>
<br />Units: none
<br />Range: false
<br />Status: Deprecated<br />
<br />This parameter controls the selection of chemical toxicity
parameter values from the chemical database. The chemical database contains
four toxicity parameters: inhalation slope factor, ingestion slope factor,
inhalation reference dose, and ingestion reference dose. There is only
one value for each parameter. Some of the values may be zero, although,
there is at least one non-zero value for inhalation (slope factor or reference
dose) and one for ingestion (slope factor or reference dose). The source
(reference) for each value is recorded in the database. Each parameter
value reference falls into one of three categories. The first category
includes toxicity values obtained from the EPA Integrated Risk Information
System (IRIS), which is considered the highest quality source for toxicity
parameter values because of the consistent methodology and review process
applied in development of the values. The second category includes
toxicity values obtained from the Health Effects Assessment Summary Tables
(HEAST), which contains toxicity values that are not provided by IRIS,
and are considered to be of higher uncertainty. The third category includes
toxicity values that are less certain and were developed using very approximate
methods.
<br />
<br />The parameter CE-TOXC was used to select values based on their source as follows:
<blockquote>
true = Use the database values from IRIS or HEAST only.
<br />
false = Use the value given in the database regardless of the source (IRIS, HEAST, other).
</blockquote>
<b>NOTE: If CE-TOXC = true and the constituent does
not have an IRIS or HEAST referenced toxicity value, then no calculation
will be performed and a zero value will be reported for the health impact.</b>

<a name="RADIONUCLIDE"></a>
<h2>RADIONUCLIDE TAB</h2>

<a name="HEINC"></a><u><b>HE-INC</b>--Calculate lifetime cancer incidence</u>
<br />Range: On or Off
<br />
<br />This parameter controls whether or not lifetime cancer
incidence will be computed for each radionuclide constituent. The box should
be checked to indicate that cancer incidence results are a desired output
result and left unchecked if cancer incidence results are not a desired
output.
<br />
<br /><a name="HECONINC"></a><u><b>HE-CONINC</b>--Lifetime cancer incidence conversion factor</u>
<br />Units: unit risk per Severt (risk/Sv)
<br />Range: 1.0E-04 to 1.0
<br />
<br />This parameter is used to specify the lifetime cancer
incidence conversion factor to be used by the code.
<br />
<br /><a name="HEFAT"></a><u><b>HE-FAT</b>--Calculate cancer fatalities</u>
<br />Range: On or Off
<br />
<br />This parameter controls whether or not lifetime cancer
fatalities will be computed for each radionuclide constituent. The box
should be checked to indicate that cancer fatality results are a desired
output result and left unchecked if cancer fatality results are not a desired
output.
<br />
<br /><a name="HECONFAT"></a><u><b>HE-CONFAT</b>--Cancer fatalities conversion factor</u>
<br />Units: unit risk per Severt (risk/Sv)
<br />Range: 1.0E-04 to 1.0
<br />
<br />This parameter is used to specify the cancer fatalities
conversion factor to be used by the code.
<br />
<br /><a name="HEFSH"></a><u><b>HE-FSH</b>--Calculate lifetime cancer and severe hereditary effects</u>
<br />Range: On or Off
<br />
<br />This parameter controls whether or not lifetime cancer
and severe hereditary effects will be computed for each radionuclide constituent.
The box should be checked to indicate that cancer and severe hereditary
effects are a desired output result and left unchecked if they are not
a desired output.
<br />
<br /><a name="HECONFSH"></a><u><b>HE-CONFSH</b>--Lifetime cancer and severe hereditary effects conversion factor</u>
<br />Units: unit risk per Severt (risk/Sv)
<br />Range: 1.0E-04 to 1.0
<br />
<br />This parameter is used to specify the lifetime cancer
and severe hereditary effects conversion factor to be used by the code.
<br />
<br /><a name="HECEDE"></a><u><b>HE-CEDE</b>--Calculate radiation dose commitment (CEDE)</u>
<br />Range: On or Off
<br />
<br />This parameter controls whether or not radiation dose
commitment will be computed for each radionuclide constituent. The box
should be checked to indicate that radiation dose commitment results are
a desired output result and left unchecked if radiation dose commitment
results are not a desired output.
<br />
<br /><a name="IHEAST"></a><u><b>IHEAST</b>--Cancer risk evaluation method</u>
<br />
<br />This parameter is used to specify the cancer risk evaluation
method to be used by the code. The user must specify one of the two choices
<blockquote>1) ICRP dose and risk factors or
<br />2) HEAST radionuclide slope factors.
</blockquote>
The user loses the method choice if either cancer fatalities or lifetime cancer
and severe hereditary effects are selected as desired outputs. If either of
these choices is selected, the user must use the ICRP dose and risk factors option.
<br />
<br /><a name="TSOIL"></a><u><b>TSOIL</b>--Thickness of contaminated soil/sediment layer</u>
<br />Units: meters (m)
<br />Range: 0.001 to 5.0
<br />
<br />This parameter is used to define the thickness of the
soil/sediment layer at the exposure location. This parameter is used
only for the external exposure from contaminated soil pathway and when
the user selects the ICRP cancer risk evaluation method.
<br />
<br /><a name="DSOIL"></a><u><b>DSOIL</b>--Density of contaminated soil/sediment layer</u>
<br />Units: grams per centimeters cubed (g/cm<sup>3</sup>)
<br />Range: 1.0 to 4.0
<br />
<br />This parameter is used to define the density of the soil/sediment
layer at the exposure location. This parameter is used only for the
external exposure from contaminated soil pathway and when the user selects
the ICRP cancer risk evaluation method.
