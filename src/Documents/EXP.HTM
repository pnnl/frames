<a name="EXPOSURE_CONTROLS"></a><h2>EXPOSURE CONTROLS TAB</h2>

<br />The exposure controls tab allows the user to
define the timing of exposure calculations, select exposure pathways to be
included, and to select the method (and provide parameter values) for evaluation
of the leaching rate constant for surface soils.

<br />
<br /><a name=ECTEXPOS></a><u><b>EC-TEXPOS</b></u>
<br />Units: yr
<br />Range: 0.0
<br />
<br />This is the time between the start of the
analysis (e.g. definition of source term quantities and beginning of transport)
and the time exposure begins.

<br />
<br /><a name=ECMAXTIM></a><u><b>EC-MAXTIM</b></u>
<br />Units: yr
<br />Range: EC-TEXPOS - 5,000,000.0
<br />
<br />This is the maximum time to consider in the
exposure analysis. It is used to determine the length of each time
increment in the exposure analysis [= (MAXTIM - TEXPOS) / NTIMES].

<br />
<br /><a name=ECNTIMES></a><u><b>EC-NTIMES</b></u>
<br />Units: none
<br />Range: &gt; 0
<br />
<br />This parameter allows the user to define the
number of time increments used in the exposure analysis. If the value
entered is zero, then time increments will be set to 1 year.

<br />
<br /><a name=ECKEXPth></a><u><b>EC-KEXPTH</b>--Exposure Pathways</u>
<br />
<br />This screen allows the user to select
exposure pathways to be included in the current analysis. A pathway is selected
for inclusion in the analysis by clicking on the box in front of the pathway
name. Boxes with an &quot;X&quot; indicate the pathways to be included.&nbsp;
Pathways are de-selected by clicking on the &quot;X&quot; again.

<br />
<br /><a name="LEACH_RATES"></a><u><b>LEACH RATES</b></u>
<br />
<br />The leach rate tab allows the user to define
the method for definition of surface soil leach rate constants, and to enter
leach rates or related parameter values. The leach rate constant (1/yr) is used
like a decay rate constant. A small value means there is little leaching and
the material stays around for a long time. Enter a small value (e.g., 1.0E-06)
to cause leaching to be ignored.

<br />
<br /><a name=ECLEACHOPTION></a><u><b>EC-LEACHOPTION</b>--Leach rate selection option</u>
<br />
<br />The pull-down menu box has two options:
&quot;User provided leach rate constants&quot; and &quot;User provides soil and
K<sub>d</sub> parameters&quot;.

<br />
<br /><a name=ECSOILLR></a><u><b>EC-SOILLR</b>--Parent and progeny surface soil leach rate constant</u>
<br />Units: 1/yr
<br />Range: 0 to 100.0
<br />
<br />Leach rate constants are entered when
&quot;User provided leach rate constants&quot; leach option is selected.&nbsp;
A leach rate constant should be entered for each parent and progeny in the
inventory list. The pull-down menu box is used to select the pollutant
for data entry. If the pollutant has progeny to consider, then an entry
set will appear (to the right of the parent set) allowing entry of leach rate
constants for all progeny.

<br />User supplied parameters for calculation of
the leach rate constant are as follows. Numerical values and correct units must
be entered for each parameter when the rate constant calculation option is
selected.

<br />
<br /><a name=ECSOILKD></a><u><b>EC-SOILKD</b>--Parent and progeny surface soil adsorption coefficient</u>
<br />Units: mL/g
<br />Range: greater than or equal to 0.0
<br />
<br />EC-SOILKD represents the equilibrium
(partition or distribution) coefficient K<sub>d</sub> of constituent between
top soil and moisture. Use laboratory or field-derived distribution coefficient
(K<sub>d</sub>) values if they are available from site documents or reports of
studies using similar soil and constituent characteristics. Typical K<sub>d</sub>
values reported in peer review literature will be provided by the user
interface if site-specific K<sub>d</sub>s are not available. Several additional
data are required for the user interface to compute a K<sub>d</sub> value for
each layer (see Section TOP SOIL PARAMETERS):
<br />For inorganic chemicals:
<blockquote>
- Soil pH (if unknown, assume neutral conditions)
<br />- Weight percent clay and iron and aluminum oxyhydroxides
</blockquote>
For organic chemicals:
<blockquote>
- Percent sand, silt, and clay and organic matter
</blockquote>
Theoretically, K<sub>d</sub> is defined as:
<br />
<center>K<sub>d</sub> = C<sub>p</sub>/C<sub>d</sub></center>
<br />where C<sub>p</sub> is the particulate
concentration (i.e., weight or activity of adsorbed constituent per weight of
solid) and C<sub>d</sub> is the dissolved concentration or activity (see
Section <a href="#WSUNITS">WS-UNITS</a>). Although the K<sub>d</sub> value of a
constituent of concern can be determined in the laboratory or obtained from
published literature, such values can vary considerably depending upon the
experimental or environmental conditions (e.g., characteristics of soil and
water) and technique used. When choosing between K<sub>d</sub> values, use the
value which will provide the conservative results (e.g., highest risk). For
example, a receptor that is living on or near the waste site and ingesting
contaminated soil would have high risk with the large K<sub>d</sub> value
because the constituent would not be readily washed off by rain and retained in
soils for an extended period of time. On the other hand, low K<sub>d</sub>
value would pose high risk to the offsite receptor that ingests water because the
constituent is readily dissolved into water and is mobilized. Note that because
of the uncertainty associated with K<sub>d</sub>, it is preferably used as a
calibration parameter to adjust the constituent velocity.
<br />
<br /><b>Selecting Adsorption Coefficient</b> - The aquifer module can provide estimates of K<sub>d</sub>
for all constituents. For inorganic constituents, typical K<sub>d</sub>
values reported in the peer reviewed literature are provided by the user
interface, via a lookup table, based on the soil water pH (KD-PH), percent clay
(KD-CLAY) and percent iron and aluminum (KD-IRON). For organic
constituents, the percent sand (KD-SAND), percent silt (KD-SILT), percent clay
(KD-CLAY), and percent organic matter (KD-OMC) are used in an empirical
equation to provide a K<sub>d</sub> estimate. The soil characteristics values
are enter through a form brought up by pressing the <b>Soil-EC-Class</b> button
<br />The dropdown box gives the user the choice to select a K<sub>d</sub> from
<ol>
<li>Database Value - provided by the connected chemical database module</li>
<li>Table Lookup Value - provided by the &quot;KD_DATA.CSV&quot; file. Primarily
 contains metals and radionuclides</li>
<blockquote>
K<sub>d</sub> = lookup(casid,col_index) where column index is calculated by</li>
<blockquote>
sum = KD-OMC + KD-CLAY + KD-IRON
<br />If PH &gt;= 9.0 Then
<br />&nbsp. If sum &gt;= 30.0 Then col_Index = 3

<br />
<br /><a name=ECTHICK></a><u><b>EC-THICK</b>--Surface soil thickness</u>
<br />Units: cm
<br />Range: 0 to 1000
<br />
<br />The thickness of the surface soil layer is
the depth in which the contamination is mixed, representing an effective
thickness for loss by leaching. For agricultural soils, the value is
typically set to 15 cm representing the depth of the plow layer. For
undisturbed soils a smaller value may be appropriate. If initial
contamination of soil is represented, then the value should be based on
information about the initial contamination depth.

<br />
<br /><a name=ECMOIST></a><u><b>EC-MOIST</b>--Surface soil moisture content</u>
<br />Units: fraction
<br />Range: 0. to 1.0
<br />
<br />The surface soil moisture content should be
set representative of the surface soil layer at the exposure location.

<br />
<br /><a name=ECBULKD></a><u><b>EC-BULKD</b>--Surface soil bulk density</u>
<br />Units: g/cm<sup>3</sup>
<br />Range: 0.5 to 3.0
<br />
<br />The bulk density is the density of surface soil at the exposure location.

<br />
<br /><a name=ECLEACV></a><u><b>EC-LEACV</b>--Total infiltration</u>
<br />Units: cm/yr
<br />Range: 0 to 500
<br />
<br />The total infiltration rate may be evaluated
as the total annual precipitation + irrigation rate - evapotranspiration rate.

<br />
<br />
<a name=PROPERTIES></a>
<h2>CONSTITUENT PROPERTIES TAB</h2>

<a name=ECNAME></a><u><b>FS-CNAME</b>--Name of constituent(s) for current transport scenario</u>
<br />
<br />This field shows the constituents that are
selected for the scenario. Use the arrow buttons to scroll through the
list of constituents and enter an adsorption coefficient and water solubility
for each one, and a degradation/decay half-life for non-radionuclides. If
a constituent has decay products, they will be shown on the bottom part of this
screen.

<br />
<br /><a name=ECGHALF></a><u><b>EC-GHALF</b>--Physical loss half-time in ground water</u>
<br /><a name=ECWHALF></a><u><b>EC-WHALF</b>--Physical loss half-time in surface water</u>
<br /><a name=ECSHALF></a><u><b>EC-SHALF</b>--Physical loss half-time in soil</u>
<br /><a name=ECTHALF></a><u><b>EC-THALF</b>--Physical loss half-time in air</u>
<br />Units: yr
<br />Range: greater than 0.0
<br />
<br />This parameter is the half-life
of the constituent in the respective media. For radionuclide and
non-radionuclide constituents, this value defaults to the data in the
constituent database, but the value can be changed to a site-specific
value. This parameter can be used to implement other degradation rates
(e.g., biodegradation, photo degradation, etc...) when they are converted to
equivalent half-lives.

 <br />Footnote: For example, the GW half-life/half-time is used by
 the Human Exposure module to represent decay or loss from closed aqueous
 systems, such as drinking water contained within the pipes of the water
 distribution system, or foods (crops, animal products, or fish) where the
 material is contained (packaged) and is not subject to volatilization losses;
 therefore, when the Human Exposure module is linked to, say, the Surface
 Water module, the GW half-life/half-time is used by the Human Exposure module
 to evaluate drinking water holdup, fish holdup, and food holdup. Holdup is
 the delay between harvest and consumption for food products. For drinking
 water, it is the delay time between entering the domestic water supply system
 and delivery to the house where the water is consumed. For home wells, the
 delay time would be small.

<h2><a name=GROUNDWATER></a>GROUND WATER TAB</h2>

The information described below must be provided
for each ground water receptor location identified for the facility. Each
ground water receptor location involves water usage that results in one or more
of the following exposure routes: ingestion of drinking water from a
contaminated well, ingestion and inhalation while showering, and ingestion of
crops and animal products produced with contaminated well water. Irrigation
with contaminated water is the primary route of exposure for crops and animal
products, although animal products may also become contaminated when animals
drink contaminated water or ingest soil contaminated by water. Ground water
transport that results in surface water contamination and exposure is
considered in the surface water exposure section (see Section <a
href="#SURFACE_WATER">SURFACE WATER TAB</a>).

<br />
<br />The following steps are provided: 1) obtain
information on domestic water usage from municipal water supply departments or
from published municipal water reports; 2) record the sources of all
information, including information obtained by telephone, in a reference or
footnote. This reference should state who was contacted (with phone number),
their position (and company), and the nature of the information obtained.

<br />
<br /><a name=EGKGDR></a><u><b>EG-KGDR</b>--Domestic Usage</u>
<br />
<br />This pull-down menu box allows selection of
the domestic uses of ground water: &quot;no domestic water usage&quot;,
&quot;shower use only&quot; or &quot;shower and drinking water&quot;.&nbsp;
Select the desired option by clicking on the line describing the option.&nbsp;
Domestic water use may include exposure pathways of drinking water ingestion,
shower water ingestion, shower water dermal contact, and inhalation of volatile
compounds during shower (or indoor inhalation).

<br />
<br /><a name=EGKGIR></a><u><b>EG-KGIR</b>--Type of irrigation use at current usage location</u>
<br />
<br />This pull-down menu box allows selection of
uses for irrigation water in production of crops and animal products. The
options to select from include:
<blockquote>
No farm production
<br />Animal drinking only (no irrigation water use)
<br />Crops and animals (feed and water)
<br />Crops and animals (feed only, no animal drinking water)
</blockquote>
Animal ingestion of soil is included when
animal feed ingestion is included. To inhibit animal soil ingestion, set
the animal soil intake parameter to zero, for meat animals or milk
(<a href="#ECUSLMT">EC-USMLT)</a> animals (<a href="#ECUSLMK">EC-USMLK</a>).

<br />
<br /><a name=EGDURATIONS></a><u><b>DURATIONS</b></u>
<br />
<br />The durations tab under the ground water tab allow
for input of exposure duration to domestic water pathways and the holdup time
for water transport from the water intake plant to the point of consumption.

<br />
<br /><a name=EGDGWED></a><u><b>EG-DGWED</b>--Exposure duration</u>
<br />Units: yr
<br />Range: 1.0 to 100
<br />
<br />The exposure duration is the number of years
that individuals are exposed do domestic water use pathways. (Note: while it is
possible to enter different exposure durations for each media/transport types,
the same exposure durations should be used for all pathways if the MEPAS Human
Health Impact Module is to be used. In that module, a single exposure duration
is used for all media/transport types.)

<br />
<br /><a name=EGTWtr></a><u><b>EG-TWTR</b>--The average distribution time for the water supply
system for the current usage location</u>
<br />Units: day
<br />Range: 0.0 to 100.0
<br />Default Value: 1.0
<br />
<br />This parameter represents the average
distribution time, in days, for the water supply system. The distribution time
is the interval between the time the water is pumped from the ground and when
it is consumed or used by the public. Use a typical value of 1.0 days if no
value is given (<a href="#NRC1977">NRC 1977</a>).

<br />
<br /><a name=EGDOMESTIC></a><u><b>DOMESTIC USAGE</b></u>
<br />Ground water Drinking Water Usage
<br />
<br />Only usage locations involving potentially
contaminated ground water need to be included. Required information about the
ground water drinking water pathway includes the number of people served by the
supply system, whether or not water is treated, and the water distribution
time.

<br />
<br /><a name=EGLTRTL></a><u><b>EG-LTRTL</b>--Indicates
whether or not the domestic water supply for the current receptor location is
treated</u>
<br />
<br />Click on the box if the drinking water is
treated (&quot;x&quot; in box). If the water is not treated, the box
should be blank. If no treatment information is available, assume no
water treatment. If water concentrations are based on measurements of
finished drinking water (i.e., tap water), then no water treatment should be
indicated.

<br />
<br /><a name="EG_IRRIGATION_USAGE"></a><u><b>IRRIGATION USAGE</b></u>
<br />Ground water Irrigation Usage
<br />
<br />Use of contaminated water for crop irrigation
may result in human exposure through the ingestion of contaminated agricultural
products. Input required on this screen is the fraction of a year that
irrigation occurs, and the irrigation rate.

<br />
<br /><a name=EGFIRR></a><u><b>EG-FIRR</b>--Fraction
of the year that ground water is used for irrigation</u>
<br />Units: none
<br />Range: 0.0 to 1.0
<br />Default Value: 1.0
<br />
<br />Irrigation of crops generally does not occur
throughout the entire year. This parameter allows the user to define the
fraction of the year that irrigation water is applied. Use of this
parameter should be coordinated with the irrigation rate. If the
irrigation occurs only 6 months of the year the fraction would be set to 0.5
and the irrigation application rate (during the 6 months) would be divided by
0.5 (to give the annual average rate). Use for surface water and ground
water is the same. The default is set for irrigation during the entire
year.

<br />
<br /><a name=EGCIRR></a><u><b>EG-CIRR</b>--The irrigation rate for the current water usage location</u>
<br />Units: L/m<sup>2</sup>/mon
<br />Range: 0.0 to 999.9
<br />
<br />This parameter represents the irrigation rate
over the irrigation period for the current water usage location. Obtain
the average irrigation rate from county extension agents or local irrigation
districts.

<br />
<br />

pathway as was described for the irrigation section of the ground water
pathway. Use of contaminated surface water for irrigation may result in
human exposure through ingestion of contaminated crops and animal
products. Input required on this screen is the fraction of a year that
irrigation occurs, and the irrigation rate.

<br />Units: none
<br />Range: 0.0 to 1.0
<br />Default Value: 1.0
<br />
<br />Irrigation of crops generally does not occur
throughout the entire year. This parameter allows the user to define the
fraction of the year that irrigation water is applied. Use of this parameter
should be coordinated with the irrigation rate. If the irrigation occurs
only 6 months of the year the fraction would be set to 0.5 and the irrigation
application rate (during the 6 months) would be divided by 0.5 (to give the
annual average rate). Use for surface water and ground water is the
same. The default is set for irrigation during the entire year.

<br />
<br /><a name="EW_AQUATIC_FOOD"></a><u><b>AQUATIC FOOD</b></u>
<br />
<br />There are two possible food categories in the
aquatic-food ingestion pathway: finfish (e.g., trout, catfish) and shellfish
(e.g., clams, mussels, crab). A usage location for aquatic food
production may be a river, stream, reservoir, lake, or bay. The usage may
be either commercial harvesting or sport fishing.

<br />
<br />This parameter modifies the bioaccumulation
factors read from the database or estimated by MEPAS using correlation
relationships. It should only be applied (i.e., changed from a value of
1.0) if the data values for BAF are based on whole fish measurements and not
edible fish tissue (e.g. muscle). When a value is given for an analysis,
it is applied to all constituents included in the analysis.

<br />
<br /><a name=EWRECREATIONAL></a><u><b>RECREATIONAL</b></u>
<br />
<br />Recreational activities in surface waters may
result in exposure to chemicals through swimming (inadvertent ingestion, dermal
contact), shoreline (inadvertent ingestion and dermal contact with sediment),
and exposure to radionuclides through swimming, boating, and shoreline
activities. When radionuclides are not present in the source term, only
swimming- and shoreline-related data need to be identified. The parameters
described below must be defined for each surface-water usage location.

<br />
<br /><a name=EWTSS></a><u><b>EW-TSS</b>--Thickness of shoreline sediments</u>
<br />Units: m
<br />Range: 0.0001 to 5.0
<br />
<br />Material deposited from surface water onto
shoreline sediments is assumed to be mixed in a layer of sediments. The
thickness of this layer is represented by this parameter. The value is

<h2><a name=ATMOSPHERIC></a>ATMOSPHERIC TAB</h2>

The release of constituents to the atmosphere
may result in widespread exposures by inhalation of airborne material or by
ingestion of farm products contaminated by deposition on soil or plants. A
typical release might involve the emission of volatile compounds (vaporization)
or wind suspension of particulate material.
<br />
<br />Atmospheric releases are may result in widespread
exposures to individuals in the region and via contamination of agricultural
products.
<br />
<br /><a name=EAKAIN></a><u><b>EA-KAIN</b>--Regional exposure</u>
<br />
<br />Regional exposure pathways include air
inhalation, external exposure to contaminated air, external exposure to
deposited contamination, ingestion of contaminated soil, and dermal contact
with contaminated soil. The pull-down menu box allows selection of these
regional pathways or skipping of regional pathways.

<br />
<br /><a name=EAKAAG></a><u><b>EA-KAAG</b>--Agricultural exposure</u>
<br />
<br />Agricultural exposures occur when airborne
contamination is deposited onto plants or cropland soil and subsequently
contaminates food crops or animal products. If any agricultural exposure

<br />
<br /><u><b>EM-SOILMOD</b>--Soil Model Selection Flag</u>
<br />Units: none
<br />Range: True or False
<br />
<br />All soil concentration data is supplied via the soil concentration file
(extension SCF). When the time variation of soil concentration is to be
defined by the user (and supplied via the SCF file), then the soil
concentration usage option &quot;Use time varying soil concentrations from the
SCF&quot; is selected (the flag is set to False) and all data provided in that
file is read and used. In this case, no features of the MEPAS soil
concentration model are used in the analysis.
<br />
<br />When the MEPAS soil model is to be used, the soil concentration usage
option &quot;Use initial soil concentration from the SCF to compute time
varying soil concentrations&quot; is selected (SOILMOD = True). The first
soil concentration data point is read from the SCF file and used as the initial
soil concentration. Variation in soil concentration with time is
evaluated using the MEPAS soil model that includes leaching, volatilization
loss, and radioactive decay.
<br />
<br />When soil concentration values are available, the
MEPAS exposure module can be used to evaluate exposure from soil ingestion,
soil external exposure, soil dermal contact, and inhalation of suspended
material. The parameter needed for this analysis is the exposure duration
to contaminated soil.

<br />
<br /><a name=EMSMED></a><u><b>EM-SMED</b>--Soil exposure duration</u>

<br /><b>MEPAS Exposure Model Undocumented Equations</b>
<br />
<br /><b>Deposition Velocity for Organic Chemicals</b>

<br />If the input value for the deposition velocity (<span
class=SpellE>RVDP) is zero and the constituent is an organic chemical as
determined by a positive value provided for the octanol-water
partition coefficient (RKOW), then the deposition
velocity will be estimated by the following method.

<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vd = (0.436681)(1.1E-7)(0.9 + 0.1 * Kow) / [HLC*1000 + 4.8E5 (0.9 + 0.1 * Kow)]
<br />
<br />Where
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vd = deposition velocity for transfer of constituent from air to plants (m/sec)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HLC = Henrys Law Constant for the constituent (atm m<sup>3</sup>/g-mole)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kow = octanol-water partition coefficient (dimensionless)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.9 = fraction of plant that is water
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.1 = fraction of plant that is organic mater
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.436681 = empirical constant
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1E-7 = empirical constant
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.8E5 = empirical constant
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1000 = empirical constant.
<br />
<br />A correction factor is calculated as:
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CF = 1 / (Vd * 1000)<sup>1/4</sup>
<br />
<br />If CF is greater than 1, then the deposition velocity is multiplied by CF.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vd = CF * Vd (from above equation)

<br />
<br /><b>Food Pathway Transfer Factors</b>
<br />Estimation methods are used to fill in for missing (zero)
values for food pathway transfer factors for organic chemicals.
If a positive value is provided for the octanol-water partition
coefficient, then an estimate for the missing food transfer
factor will be generated. The correlations used are as follows.
<br />
<br />Finfish
<br />The transfer from water to finfish is estimated using the correlation of Bintein, DeVillers, and Carcher (1993) as follows:
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Log10 (BFF) = 0.910 Log10 (Kow) + 1.975 Log10 (6.8E-7Kow + 1) + 0.786
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFF = water-to-finfish bioaccumulation factor (L water / kg finfish)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kow = octanol-water partition coefficient (dimensionless)
<br />
<br />Shell Fish
<br />The transfer from water to shell fish meat is estimated using the correlation from Southworth (1978) as follows:
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Log<sub>10</sub> (BFI) = 0.819 * Log<sub>10</sub>(CKOW) - 1.146
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFI = water-to-shell fish bioaccumulation factor (L water / kg shell fish)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kow = octanol-water partition coefficient (dimensionless)
<br />
<br />Meat (beef)
<br />The feed-to-meat transfer factor is estimated using the correlation from Travis and Arms (1988) as follows:
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Log<sub>10</sub> (BMT) = -7.60 + Log<sub>10</sub>(Kow)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BMT = feed-to-meat transfer factor (mg/kg meat per mg/day intake by animal)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kow = octanol-water partition coefficient (dimensionless)
<br />
<br />Milk (cow)
<br />The feed-to-milk transfer factor is estimated using the correlation from Travis and Arms (1988) as follows:
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Log<sub>10</sub> (BMK) = -8.10 + Log<sub>10</sub>(Kow)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BMK = feed-to-milk transfer factor (mg/L milk per mg/day intake byanimal)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kow = octanol-water partition coefficient (dimensionless)
<br />
<br />Plants
<br />The soil-to-plant uptake factor is estimated using a correlation from Travis and Arms (1988) as follows:
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Log<sub>10</sub>(BVF) = 0.986 - 0.578 * Log<sub>10</sub>(Kow)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BVF = soil-to-plant uptake factor (kg dry soil / kg wet plant)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kow = octanol-water partition coefficient (dimensionless)
<br />
<br />The correlation has been modified to provide the soil-to-plant uptake factor on a wet-weigh of plant basis.
