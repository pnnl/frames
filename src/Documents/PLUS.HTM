<p>During dry seasons when surface stream flows are low, groundwater discharge can contribute a major portion of the stream flow. For some watershed conditions, groundwater discharge can be the primary contributor to flow in small streams. For these reasons, it is necessary to include a contribution of MC loading from groundwater flow in surface water.</p>

<p>This module consumes the MEPAS Aquifer water flux file (WFF) which contains aquifer flow (m3/yr) and aquifer mass flux (g/yr) at a user location, which is specified in the MEPAS Aquifer model user interface. The user location in this case should be the distance from the center of the AOI to the receiving stream or pooled surface water body of interest. Since receiving surface water bodies must be able to receive surface water runoff from the AOI soil as well as groundwater discharge, the new module must also be able to combine surface and aquifer water flux files (WFFs). A Plus Operator was developed for the Adaptive Risk Assessment Modeling System (ARAMS, http://el.erdc.usace.army.mil/arams/arams.html) that allows one to combine two or more WFFs into one, but the WFFs had to be of the same type, such as either aquifer or surface water. The reason for this is that the surface water WFF contains mass flux for dissolved and adsorbed mass flux, whereas the aquifer WFF contains only total mass flux.</p>

<p><b><i>Incoming Module ID</i></b>
<br>The list of incoming modules is identified by the CSM (Conceptual Site Model).&nbsp; Each of the module appears in this drop-down box.&nbsp; Use the drop down-box to make differeent module selections.&nbsp; As a new selection is made the the groundwater flow to surface water is updated with the appropriate flow rate or fraction.</p>

<p>If using "WFF Surface Water and Aquifer Percent Plus Operator"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><i>Groundwater flow to surface water</i></b>
<br>Units: fraction
<br>Range: Greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.
<p>Enter the groundwater flow to surface water as faction of the flow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If using "WFF Surface Water and Aquifer Plus Operator"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><i>Groundwater flow to surface water</i></b>
<br>Units: m^3/yr (meter cubic per year)
<br>Range: Greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.
<p>Enter the groundwater flow to surface water as rate of the flow.</p>
