<p>During dry seasons when surface stream flows are low, groundwater discharge can contribute a major portion of the stream flow. For some watershed conditions, groundwater discharge can be the primary contributor to flow in small streams. For these reasons, it is necessary to include a contribution of contaminant loading from groundwater flow in surface water.</p>

<p>The Plus-SG Operator is the Water Flux File (WFF) Surface water and Groundwater (aquifer) Plus Operator. This module consumes the MEPAS Aquifer water flux file (WFF) which contains aquifer flow (m3/yr) and aquifer mass flux (g/yr) at a user location, which is specified in the MEPAS Aquifer model user interface. The user location in this case should be the distance from the center of the AOI to the receiving stream or pooled surface water body of interest. Since receiving surface water bodies must be able to receive surface water runoff from the AOI soil as well as groundwater discharge, this module must also be able to combine surface water and aquifer water flux files (WFFs). The surface water WFF contains mass flux for dissolved and adsorbed mass flux, whereas the aquifer WFF contains only total mass flux, which is actually dissolved. Thus, this operator combines the surface water dissolved and aquifer mass fluxes, as well as the water flow rates.</p>

<p><b><i>Incoming Module ID</i></b>
<br>The list of incoming modules is identified by the CSM (Conceptual Site Model).  Each of the modules appear in this drop-down box.  Use the drop down-box to make different module selections.  As a new selection is made, the groundwater flow to surface water is updated with the appropriate flow rate or fraction of total flow rate in groundwater. There are two Plus-SG Plus operator versions, one for fraction or percent of groundwater total flow and one for groundwater flow, as described below.</p>

<p>If using "WFF Surface Water and Aquifer Percent Plus Operator"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><i>Groundwater flow to surface water</i></b>
<br>Units: fraction
<br>Range: Greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.
<p>Enter the groundwater flow to surface water as faction of the flow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If using "WFF Surface Water and Aquifer Plus Operator"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><i>Groundwater flow to surface water</i></b>
<br>Units: m^3/yr (meter cubic per year)
<br>Range: Greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.
<p>Enter the groundwater flow to surface water as rate of the flow.</p>
</blockquote>
