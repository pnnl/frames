<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Multimedia Environmental
Pollutant Assessment System (MEPAS) is a physics-based environmental analysis
code that integrates source-term, transport, and exposure models for endpoints
such as concentration, dose, or risk. Developed by Pacific Northwest Laboratory<sup>(a)</sup>,
MEPAS is designed for site-specific assessments using readily available
information. Endpoints are computed for chemical and radioactive pollutants.
For human health impacts, risks are computed for carcinogens and hazard
quotients for noncarcinogens. This system has wide applicability to a range
of environmental problems using air, groundwater, surface-water, overland,
and exposure models. With this system, a user can simulate release from
the source, transport through air, groundwater, surface water, or overland,
and transfer through food chains and exposure pathways to the exposed individual
or population. Whenever available and appropriate, U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency guidance and models were used to facilitate compatibility and acceptance.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although based on relatively
standard transport and exposure computation approaches, the unique feature
of MEPAS is that these approaches are integrated into a single system.
The use of a single system provides a consistent basis for evaluating health
impacts for a large number of problems and sites. Implemented on a desktop
computer, a user-friendly shell allows the user to define the problem,
input the required data, and execute the appropriate models. This document
describes mathematical formulations used in the MEPAS exposure assessment
and human health impact component.

<br>

<br>The Multimedia Environmental Pollutant Assessment
System (MEPAS) provides physics-based models for human health risk assessment
for radioactive and hazardous pollutants. MEPAS analyzes pollutant behavior
in various media (air, soil, groundwater and surface water) and estimates
transport through and between media and exposure and impacts to the environment,
to the maximum individual, and to populations. MEPAS includes 25 exposure
pathway models, a database with information on more than 650 contaminants,
and a sensitivity module that allows for uncertainty analysis.

<br>

<br>Four major transport pathways are considered
in MEPAS: groundwater, overland, surface water, and atmospheric. Descriptions
of the mathematical basis of each of these components will be published
in companion reports. Guidelines for determining input parameter values
are provided in Buck et al. (1995).

<br>

<br>This report describes the exposure pathway
and health impact assessment component of MEPAS, which provides an estimate
of health impacts to selected individuals and populations from exposure
to pollutants. The exposure pathway analysis starts with pollutant concentration
in a transport medium and estimates the average daily dose to exposed individuals
from contact with the transport medium or a secondary medium contaminated
by the transport medium.

<br>

<br>The average daily dose is then used to estimate
a measure of health impact appropriate to the type of pollutant considered.

<br>

<br>Discussions of the exposure pathway models
include the assumptions and equations used to convert the transport medium
concentrations to exposure medium concentrations. The discussion for a
given exposure pathway defines the transport pathways leading to the exposure,
the special processes considered in determining the pollutant concentration
in the exposure medium, and the exposure model used to estimate the average
daily dose. Models for the exposure pathway and health impact assessments
require definition of several parameters. A summary of the notation used
for these parameters is provided. The default values used in MEPAS for
these parameters are presented and discussed.
