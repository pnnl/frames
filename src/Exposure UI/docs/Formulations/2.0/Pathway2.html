<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
section describes details of the exposure pathway models used in MEPAS.
The pathway descriptions are organized by intake route (ingestion, dermal
contact, inhalation, and external radiation exposure) and by purpose of
transport medium usage (domestic water, aquatic foods, etc.).

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ingestion pathways
include ingestion of drinking water, ingestion of water while showering,
ingestion of agricultural products (leafy vegetables, other vegetables,
meat, and milk), ingestion of aquatic foods (fin fish and shellfish), ingestion
of water or sediment while participating in aquatic recreational activities
(swimming, boating, or shoreline use), ingestion of soil, and ingestion
of special foods (for which measured pollutant concentrations are available).
Dermal exposure pathways include contact with soil, shoreline sediments,
and water (while swimming or showering). Inhalation exposure pathways include
inhalation of air transported from the release site to the exposure location,
inhalation of resuspended particulate material from soil, and inhalation
of volatile pollutants released from shower water or other domestic water
uses. External exposure may occur from proximity of individuals to radionuclides
on ground (deposited from air, deposited onto shoreline sediment, or for
measured soil concentrations), in water (swimming and boating), or in air
(submersion in a passing plume). The direct radiation dose rate measurement
pathway is also an external exposure route.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six
major transport pathways are considered in MEPAS including special pathways
for handling exposure to measured pollutant levels in soils and foods,
and measurement of direct radiation fields. These transport pathways and
their associated exposure pathways are listed in Table 2.1. This table
also indicates the transport medium, the exposure medium, and the intake
or exposure route for each exposure pathway.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The subsections that follow describe the models used for each of the exposure
pathways. The discussion for a given exposure pathway defines the

<br>transport pathways leading to the
exposure pathway, the special transfers and processes considered in determining
the pollutant concentration in the exposure medium, and the exposure model
used to estimate the average daily dose or lifetime radiation dose. The
estimation of health impacts from the average daily dose is described in
Section 3.0.
