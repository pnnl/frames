MODULE VERSION
  5.0 Compiled on 11/2/2006,  UI compiled on 6/28/2007

MODULE DESCRIPTION
The MEPAS Receptor Intakes Module evaluates the
intake or exposure of an individual from consumption
or contact with contaminated media, or exposure to
radiation in contaminated media.  Standard EPA
methods are used to evaluate the average daily
intake rate of chemical pollutants for each exposure
pathway, based on user defined consumption/contact
rates and body weight. The module includes
consideration of domestic water use, farm product
consumption, aquatic food consumption, surface water
recreational activities, soil contact exposure, and
air exposures.  Both chemical and radioactive
pollutants may be evaluated.  EPA models are used
to evaluate dermal contact with soil and water.
The module evaluates intakes for one age group per
receptor definition and for all input exposure routes
defined in the EPF file and recognized by MEPAS.

Limitations:
  None
