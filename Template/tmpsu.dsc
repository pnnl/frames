TmpSU - This template provides an example of the use of the SUM3 sensitivity/uncertainty module.  In this case, a scenario of acute atmospheric releases from a single source is demonstrated, using the GENII Acute Plume dispersion module to estimate the atmospheric dispersion, the GENII Acute Exposure Module to estimate accumulation in the biosphere, the GENII Receptor Intake module to describe human behavior in the scenario, and the GENII Health Impacts module for estimation of dose and/or risk.  Each of these is connected to the SUM3 module, allowing any and/or all input parameters to the calculation to be varied as selected by the user.
