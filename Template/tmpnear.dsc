TmpNear - This is a set of pre-selected GENII modules that provide a starting place for scenarios in which the initial surface soil, buried soil, or buried waste container concentrations of radioactive contaminants are known.  The user needs to select the contaminants with the Constituent Editor, and then input the initial concentrations in the User-Defined soil input module.  The GENII Near-Field Exposure Module is used to estimate distribution and accumulation in the biosphere. Human exposure is defined in the GENII Receptor Intake module, and the GENII Health Impacts module provides estimation of dose and/or risk.
