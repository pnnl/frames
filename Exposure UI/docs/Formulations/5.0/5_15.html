<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The model for inadvertent ingestion of shoreline
sediments requires an estimate of the time spent in shoreline activities
and the rate at which shoreline sediments are ingested. Default values
for these parameters are given in Table 5.15.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that the product of shoreline event time and
shoreline frequency is equal to an average daily exposure time of 0.033
hours, consistent with the initial MEPAS daily shoreline exposure time.
The hourly sediment ingestion intake values are set equal to the daily
USEPA (USEPA 1989) recommended values for soil ingestion intake. This is
done because shoreline activities are expected to represent a high-contact
situation and inadvertent ingestion rates would be considerably higher
than rates for normal daily activities.
