<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exposure pathways involving swimming all require
definition of the duration of a swimming event and the frequency of swimming.
Other parameters are required for specific swimming pathways. For inadvertent
ingestion of water while swimming the default parameter values are given
in Table 5.12.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that the product of swimming event time and
swimming frequency is equal to an average daily swimming time of 0.033
hours, consistent with the initial MEPAS daily swimming time.
