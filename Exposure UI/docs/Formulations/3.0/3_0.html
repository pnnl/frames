<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Human health impacts are estimated from the average
daily dose provided by the exposure pathway models. Models used for conversion
of the average daily dose to health impacts are described in the following
sections. Models are described for impacts from radiation exposure (radionuclides
and measured direct radiation), carcinogenic chemicals, and noncarcinogenic
chemicals. The first sections describe models for health impact assessments
for exposure of an individual or an average member of the population. The
last section describes extension of the individual results to estimation
of impacts for the entire exposed population.
