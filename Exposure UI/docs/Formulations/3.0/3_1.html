<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Health impacts from exposure to radiation and radionuclides
are expressed as the risk of developing cancer. This risk may be reported
as the lifetime risk of total cancer incidence or as cancer fatalities.
Two methods are available to estimate the risk of cancer fatalities: use
of health- effects conversion factors and use of USEPA slope factors. These
methods are described in the following section.
