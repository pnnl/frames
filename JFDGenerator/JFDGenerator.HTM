<HR>
<P>The Joint Frequency Data (JFD) Generator creates climatological summary files containing the
frequencies of occurrence of meteorological dispersion, wind speed, and wind direction conditions
(Droppo 2007<A href="http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-16149.pdf ">;
Droppo and Pelton 2006)</A>. These climatological data are used by air dispersion models to compute
patterns of air and soil concentrations.  Those data should be based on records from the nearest
meteorological observation station that will have weather conditions that are most representative
of the area to be modeled.  In United States, the Environmental Data Service, NOAA, National
Climatic Center (NCC) in Asheville, North Carolina is the major supplier of such
data.  Alternatively other agencies and organizations supply summaries of meteorological data.
<P>The JFD generator is based on an updated version of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) STAR (STAbility ARray) program (EPA, 2006).  The EPA STAR program converts hourly
meteorological surface observation data (in CD-144 data format only) to joint frequency
tables for use in a number of EPA air dispersion programs.  Surface observations are combined
with computed seasonally and diurnally varying solar flux rates to estimate the ambient
atmospheric dispersion rates (i.e. stability category).  The wind speeds and directions
are obtained directly from the hourly surface observation data.
<P>Prior to using this program, the user will need to obtain a file containing historical
records of surface meteorological observations from an onsite or nearby location.  That data
file must have either a "DAT" or "SAM" extension and should be stored in an accessible
directory.  In addition to the CD-144 format, the  updated version can read Samson and SCRAM
data formats available on the an EPA Website (2006)
(<A href="http://www.epa.gov/scram001">http://www.epa.gov/scram001</A>),
as data products from NOAA (<A href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov">http://www.nws.noaa.gov</A>),
and other websites (e.g. Lakes Environmental (2006)
<A href="http://www.lakes-environmental.com">http://www.lakes-environmental.com</A>). The
JFD Generator  updated version of STAR will use those data to create an JFD files for use
in air dispersion models.
<P>The “JFD Generator” input window shown below provides the capability of generating data
files with JFD and STR extensions for use in air dispersion codes. Files with the extension
JFD can be used directly by MEPAS.  By deleting the fist line of data in JFD files, these
files also can be used directly by programs using the original STAR output format. The STR
data files can be used directly by the GENII program.

<P>The contents of this window are:
<P><b>NOAA Met File [path\name]</B><BR> Identify the input data file with an annual cycle
of hourly surface observation data.   The square browse button on the right should be used
to select the input data file and its path. Note that a data file containing meteorological
observations representative of the analyses area (with either an "DAT" or "SAM" extension)
must be obtained prior to using this program.  Sources of such data are discussed above.
<P>The JFD generator supports input of Samson (SAM extension) , CD-144 (DAT extension), and
SCRAM (DAT extension) data file formats.  Additional parameter inputs are required for the
DAT files (to define information that is contained within the SAM files).  Once a DAT file
is selected, the program recognize which type of DAT file (CD-144 or SCRAM) has been selected.
<P><b>Output File [path\name]</B><BR>
The name and path of the output JFD data file that will be produced are displayed.  The name
and path of the input data file are used to define the names and location of the JFD and STR
output files.
<P><b>NOAA designation</B><BR>
Enter the “Surface Station Number” for the selected meteorological observation station.  This
number is normally both incorporated in the name of the input data file as well as in the
data contained in the input data file.  In the United States, this number represents a five
digit “Surface Station Number” assigned to each location where meteorological surface
observations are available.
<P>When the JFD are imported into MEPAS, the NOAA designation for “Surface Station Number” will
be loaded into the MEPAS variable “AC-LCDREF--Reference weather station.”
<P><b>Starting year</B><BR>
Enter two-digit code for year of data to be processed (i.e. 88, 90, 02).  This year code is
normally incorporated in the input data file name.  The JFD generator will also process the
file if a four digit year is entered.
<P><b>Station Name</B> (required for DAT files only) <BR>
Document the source of the joint frequency summary data.  Enter a name that describes the
location at which the joint frequency data were taken (normally the name of a nearby city
or airport).  Use a descriptive name to designate the location where onsite data were taken.
<P>When the JFD are imported into MEPAS, the “Station Name” will be loaded into the MEPAS
variable “AJ-STATNM--Data station.”
<P><B>Two letter state abbreviation</B> (required for DAT files only)<BR>
Enter the two letter postal code abbreviation for the state in which the surface station
is located.
<P><B>Time Zone</B> (required for DAT files only)<BR>
 Enter a numeric code for the time zone which the station is located.  The STAR program
 supports the four time zones used in contiguous United States.  The time codes are:
<BR>
<BR>Eastern Time Zone = 075
<BR>Central Time Zone = 090
<BR>Mountain Time Zone = 105
<BR>Pacific Time Zone = 120
<BR>Alaska Time Zone = 150 *
<BR>
<BR>* Applicably of a Zone 150 application
<BR>should be tested: Zone 150 lies outside
<BR>continental United States for which the
<BR>STARR program was developed.
<P><B>Latitude</B> (xx.xx degrees)<BR>
 (required for DAT files only) – Enter north latitude of station.
<P><B>Longitude</B> (xx.xx degrees)<BR>
 (required for DAT files only) – Enter west longitude of station.
<P><B>Elevation</B> (m) (required for DAT files only)<BR>
 Enter the elevation of the station above sea level in meters.
<P><B>Anemometer height</B> (m) <BR>
 Enter the height at which the winds were measured for the joint frequency distribution.  This
 height can be obtained from the source of the joint frequency data (i.e., facility
 documentation for onsite data), from the last page of the LCD summary for NCDC data,
 or weather station documentation reports.   A typical value for joint frequency
 anemometer height about s 3 m.
<P>When the JFD are imported into MEPAS, the “Anemometer height” will be loaded into
the MEPAS variable “AJ-ANEMHT--Anemometer height.”   This parameter is not used in the
generation of the JFD file but is needed for subsequent computations by the air
dispersion model using the JFD.
<P><B>Surface roughness length</B> (cm) <BR>
 Enter an average roughness length for the area surrounding the weather station
 being used to generate a wind joint frequency summary.  The typical value for roughness
 length is 10 cm.
<P>When the JFD are imported into MEPAS, the “Surface roughness length” will be loaded
into the MEPAS variable “AJ-RLEN--Average roughness length.”   This parameter is not
used in the generation of the JFD file but is needed for subsequent computations by
the air dispersion model using the JFD.
<P><B>Months to include</B><BR>
 Check the months during the year that are to be used to generate the JFD.  Climatological air dispersion models such as MEPAS considers annual exposures – and normally all months are checked to create an annual JFD summary.  This option allows JFD files to be created based on some subset of the months with emissions – the months with emissions should be checked.
<P><B>Generate JFD</B><BR>
 When all the required fields are populated, click on this button to create data files in JFD and STR formats.
<P>If the output JFD data files fail to be created, the cause is normally an early termination of the STAR program by an incorrect entry for one of the input parameters.   Also, it is important to select the input file by using the browse button (rather than by typing the path ad name) to assure the path is properly set in the program.
<P>The JFD Generator needs to be applied in fashion consistent with the following constraints:
<LI>All surface observation data processed should be for 1964 or later.  The revised STAR program does not apply to data formats for wind direction used before 1964.
<LI>The revised STAR program generates JFD files with JFD and STR extensions. Files with the extension JFD can be used directly by MEPAS.  By deleting the first line of data in JFD files, these files also can be used directly by programs using the original STAR output format. The STR data files can be used directly by the GENII program.
<LI>Although the capability still exists in the revised STAR code to generate summaries in other formats for other models, that capability has not been tested for the revised version of the STAR program and thus is unavailable in the JFD generator interface.
<LI>The revised STAR program implements a proportional directional binning of  observations.  The original STAR program had bias for certain wind directions generated by the process of binning reported wind direction observations in 36 10-degree sectors into the 16 22.5-degree sectors used in the JFD tables. The revised STAR program eliminates this bias such that the input of uniform frequencies of winds in 36 10-degree sectors gives uniform frequencies in the 16 22.5-degree sectors.
<LI>Calm conditions are not listed separately in the JFD output tables but rather binned as low wind speed occurrences by the STAR program.  This assignment of calms to low wind conditions is equivalent to the manner in which calm conditions are used in the MEPAS code.
<LI>The STAR program is designed for use only with data from Continental United States.
