  As you can see, you connect all ATO modules of the same release type
 (chronic or acute) as inputs to the ATO plus operator (in this case
 it's actually a chronic ATO plus operator. The output is one
 cartesian grid: the result of the superposition and union of all
 input grids.<br/>

  This shot illustrates that you can input all chronic ato, whether
 cartesian or polar or linear.  However, this particular module will
 convert all input to cartesian grids.<br/>

<p>
  This is just an example of what I have so far.  Please keep in mind
 that module names can change.  I'm not sure yet if there will be four
 ATO modules for each combination of Chronic/Acute and
 Polar/Cartesian, or if it will be simplified into two modules for
 just Chronic/Acute.
