  Since there is quite a bit of stuff going on under the hood when
 merging ATO files, this document is provided to explain the process
 and the reasoning behind it. 
</p>

<p>
 The use of ATO in this document refers not to the concept of ATO,
 but to an ATO dataset.  Also, in this document, by 'add' I mean
 'merge'.
</p>

<p>
 Check out the <a href="example/example.html">example</a> if
 necessary.  This document is explaning what happens in the area
 circled in red in the picture below.
</p>
<center><img src="pics/two_merge.jpg"/><br/></center>

Let 'pls' represent the ATO plus operator. In the picture example
above, 'pls' would represent the "Chronic_air_merge (pls5)"
module. Here is the overall jist of 
it.
<pre>
    The dataset of pls starts out empty

    For each n in pls inputs
      Read dataset n
      Offset grids in dataset n
      Add dataset n to plus dataset
    Next n

    Write pls
</pre>

<p>
The "offset grids in dataset n" is used to offset grids relative
to a release point.  By default, the Northing and Easting coordinate
points are 0,0.  These values can be changed in the General Info box
of the input ATO dataset.  If changed, then each grid is offset to
it's new position so that the Northing and Easting coordinates become
it's new origin.
</p>
<p>
<em>A technical note:</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;The parents never do checks to
make sure their "children" can be added.  For example, a time period
has n children, which are grids.  The time period does not check to
make sure that the grids are compatible before attempting to add them.
The time period assumes that the grids do any necessary validation.
The same goes with contaminants and their time period children, and
datasets and their contaminant children.
</p>
<p>
Reading and writing of the actual datasets is trivial, and need not be
explained.
</p>
Here is how two datasets, x and y, are added:
<pre>
  Make sure datasets match. They should have
    The same release types (both "acute" or both "polar")
  Add flux types
  If two constituents have the same name and Id
    Let xcon be the constituent in x and ycon be the one in y
    Now merge the time periods of xcon and ycon
      Let xtime represent the current time period in xcon
      Let ytime represent the current time period in ycon
      If xtime = ytime Then
        xtime = xtime + ytime
      otherwise
        Find two ytimes, such that ytime1 < xtime < ytime2
        Interpolate ytime1 and ytime2 at xtime
        xtime = xtime + interpolation of xtime and ytime
    Done merging
  Otherwise (if the constituents don't match)
    Append the constituent to x
  Repeat for progenies
</pre>
<p>
As you can see, if a constituent of y was not in x, then that
constituent is just appended to the x dataset.  If they do match, then
their time periods are merged.  If, say, a time period from xcon is
not found in ycon, then two times from ycon (one greater than x, one
less than) is used to interpolate a time period that matches the one
in xcon, so that they can be added.
</p>
Here is how two time periods, xtime and ytime, are added:
<pre>
  Make sure the time periods match (ie are at the same time)
  Let xgrid be the current output grid at xtime
  Let ygrid be the current output grid at ytime
  If xgrid and ygrid match
    xgrid = xgrid + ygrid
  Otherwise
    Append ygrid to xgrid
</pre>
Here is how two grids, xgrid and ygrid, are added:
<pre>
  Make sure the grids match.  They must have the same:
    Output name
    Flux type
    Moist type
  If xgrid and ygrid have different grid types or spatial types:
    Convert ygrid to match xgrid (ygrid is interpolated)
  xgrid = xgrid + ygrid
</pre>
