   In this folder are tests I have run on the ATO.  They are, to my
   best intentions, an accurate testing of the necessary functionality
   of ATO merging.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>Also please make note</b> that I used my intuition on these
   tests, and no systematic process to assure that every single value
   was merged/converted correctly.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most tests, if not all, have an ato, csv, and xls file.  To open
   and run each test, use the atotest.gid.  you must rename the
   appropriate test you want to run to atotest.ato.  for example, if
   you want to test cartesian to polar with cartToPolar, then rename
   the cartToPolar.ato to atotest.ato.  Then you can open up the
   atotest.gid with FRAMES.<br/><br/>
   <b>ato</b> -- The input ato data that I have created by hand or
 generated using the Mepas 4.1 air model, according to the
 specifications listed on the <a
 href="http://mepas.pnl.gov/FRAMESV1/pdcf.html">FRAMES 1.x
 website</a>.<br/>
   <b>csv</b> -- the result of the ato merge.<br/>
   <b>xls</b> -- a spreadsheet I was using to compare and/or graph
 results.<br/>
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>cartToPolar.ato</b> -- used to test conversion from cartesian to
   polar.<br/>
   <b>difftypes.ato</b> -- used to test merging of one type cartesian
 with one type polar.<br/>
   <b>interpolated.ato</b>  -- testing that the actual values of each
 grid cell were correctly interpolated.<br/>
   <b>offset.ato</b> -- testing that grids from one dataset will
 properly be merged with grids from a different dataset that is
 offset, and that the resulting grids contain only the merge of
 overlapping points, and to resize the output grids to encompass the
 bounds of both input dataset grids.<br/>
   <b>polarToCart.ato</b> -- that values will be correctly converted
 from polar to cartesian.<br/>
