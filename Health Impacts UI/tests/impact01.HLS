Chemical toxicity data source flag = 0:
Chemical toxicity values in the MEPAS chemical database are used.
Radiation dose factors from EPA Federal Guidance  Reports No. 11 and 12 are used.
Radionuclide consequenses will be reported as radiation dose (Sv).
Radiation dose factors from EPA Federal Guidance  Reports No. 11 and 12 are used.
Radionuclide consequenses will be reported as cancer incidence risk.
Radionuclide consequenses will be reported as radiation dose (Sv).
Chemical health impact endpoints are evaluated based on input
information in the Receptor Intake File (RIF) and the following selections.
If the RIF file does not contain information for an endpoint, it is not calculated.
Perform chemical impact analyses for carcinogenic effects
Perform chemical impact analyses for non-carcinogenic effects
